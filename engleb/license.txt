Preface

You can give away the Lexham English Bible, but you can't sell it on its own. If the LEB comprises less than 25% of the content of a larger work, you can sell it as part of that work.

If you give away the LEB for use with a commercial product, or sell a work containing more than 1,000 verses from the LEB, you must annually report the number of units sold, distributed, and/or downloaded.

You must always attribute quotations of the LEB.

If you quote less than 100 verses of the LEB in a single work you can attribute it by simply adding (LEB) after the quotation. Longer quotations, or use of 100 or more verses in a single work, must be accompanied by the following statement:

Scripture quotations marked (LEB) are from the Lexham English Bible. Copyright 2012 Logos Bible Software. Lexham is a registered trademark of Logos Bible Software.

In electronic use, link "LEB" and "Lexham English Bible" to http://www.lexhamenglishbible.com, and "Logos Bible Software" to http://www.logos.com. If all quotations are unmarked and from the LEB, you may remove "marked (LEB) are" from the statement.

In support of non-English Bible translation, non-profit organizations may use 50% as the maximum portion the LEB may comprise of a work offered for sale. (This specifically allows the creation and commercial sale of diglot Bibles.)

Lexham is a registered trademark of Logos Bible Software. You may use LEB or Lexham English Bible to refer to the Lexham English Bible, but may not use the Lexham trademark as any part of the name of a larger work quoting or containing it.
Q. Can a for-profit company that sells Bible software distribute the LEB?

A. Yes. The LEB can be made available as an add-on module, e-book, or even distributed with purchased software, provided the LEB is no more than 25% of the content available for the software, and the distributor annually reports to Logos Bible Software the number of units distributed and/or downloaded. These reports may be sent to copyright@lexhampress.com.
Q. Can I record a dramatic reading of the LEB and sell it?

A. No. You can record and distribute the LEB in audio form for free, but would need specific permission in order to sell the audio recording, since the LEB would comprise nearly all the content of your audio recording.
Q. Can I quote the LEB in a book or course or video I am selling?

A. Yes, as long as the LEB comprises no more than 25% of the content of the book, course or video, and you annually report the number of units you sell.
Q. Can I write a commentary on the LEB?

A. Yes. It can even contain the entire Lexham English Bible. You may not use the Lexham trademark in the name of your commentary (you may not call it the Lexham Bible Commentary, for example), but you can (and must) attribute the LEB as explained in the license.
Q. Can I put the LEB on a web site that takes advertising?

A. Yes, if the LEB is not more than 25% of the substantive content of your site, and if you attribute it (with links) as required by the license.
Q. Can I use the LEB icon or logo?

A. Yes, but only in reference to the Lexham English Bible, with attribution as required by the license.
Q. What's the spirit of the LEB license?

A. Attribute the LEB when you quote or use it, don't make money selling it on its own without getting permission, and if you do sell something that quotes a large portion (1,000 verses or more), or give the LEB away in support of a commercial product, we want to know how many copies were distributed each year.
Q. Can I print the LEB and sell it at cost?

A. We’re working on a print edition, which we will be announcing more about soon. For now, you can print excerpts to give away (or even a whole biblical book for that matter), but you may not print it and sell it.
Q. Can I print the LEB and give it away?

A. Yes.
Q: Who can I contact for more information?

A. Contact customerservice@logos.com.
