PHILEMON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 1
Phm 1:1	Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker,
Phm 1:2	and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.
Phm 1:3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Phm 1:4	I thank my God, always making mention of you in my prayers,
Phm 1:5	[because I]<note: *Here "[because]" is supplied as a component of the participle ("hear about") which is understood as causal> hear about your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.
Phm 1:6	[I pray] that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge [of] every good [thing] that [is] in us for Christ.
Phm 1:7	For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. 

Phm 1:8	Therefore, [although I]<note: *Here "[although]" is supplied as a component of the participle ("have") which is understood as concessive> have great confidence in Christ to order you [to do what] is proper,
Phm 1:9	instead I appeal to [you] because of love, [since I]<note: *Here "[since]" is supplied as a component of the participle ("am") which is understood as causal> am such a one as Paul, now an old man and also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
Phm 1:10	I am appealing to you concerning my child whom I became the father of during my imprisonment, Onesimus.
Phm 1:11	Once he [was] useless to you, but now [he is] useful to you<note: Some manuscripts have "both to you"> and to me,
Phm 1:12	whom I have sent back to you himself, that is, my heart,
Phm 1:13	whom I wanted to keep with me, in order that he might serve me on behalf of you during my imprisonment for the gospel.
Phm 1:14	But apart from your consent, I wanted to do nothing, in order that your good [deed] might be not as according to necessity, but according to [your own] free will.
Phm 1:15	For perhaps because of this, he was separated [from you] for a time, in order that you might have him back forever,
Phm 1:16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 

Phm 1:17	If therefore you consider me a partner, receive him as [you would] me.
Phm 1:18	But if in anything he has caused you loss or owes [you anything], {charge this to my account}<note: Literally "this to me charge to [my] account">.
Phm 1:19	I, Paul, write [this] with my [own] hand: I will pay it back, lest I mention to you that {you owe me even your very self besides}<note: Literally "even yourself to me you owe besides">.
Phm 1:20	Yes, brother, I ought to have some benefit of you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 

Phm 1:21	Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you [because I]<note: *Here "[because]" is supplied as a component of the participle ("know") which is understood as causal> know that you will do even beyond what I say.
Phm 1:22	At the same time also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 

Phm 1:23	Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
Phm 1:24	[and so do] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, [and] Luke, my fellow workers.
Phm 1:25	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
