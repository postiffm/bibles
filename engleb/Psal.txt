Ps 73:1	Surely God is good to Israel, to those pure of heart.
Ps 73:2	But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled. My steps had nearly slipped,
Ps 73:3	because I envied the boastful [when] I saw [the] well-being<note: Or "peace" or "prosperity"> of [the] wicked.
Ps 73:4	For there are no pains up to their death, and their bodies [are] {healthy}.<note: Literally "fat">
Ps 73:5	They do not have {ordinary trouble},<note: Literally "the trouble of man"> and they are not plagued as [other] people.<note: Hebrew "humankind">
Ps 73:6	Therefore pride is their necklace; an outfit of violence covers them.

Ps 73:14	And I have been plagued all day and rebuked {every morning}.<note: Literally "to the mornings">
Ps 73:15	If I had said, "I will speak thus," behold, I would have acted treacherously against your children's generation.
Ps 73:16	When I thought about [how] to understand this, it [was] troubling in my eyes
Ps 73:17	until I went into the sanctuary of God. [Then] I understood their fate.
Ps 73:18	Surely you set them on slippery places. You cause them to fall onto ruin.<note: Or "fall for deceptions">
Ps 73:19	How they become a desolation in a moment! They come to a complete end by terrors.
Ps 73:20	Like a dream upon awakening, when [you] wake up, O Lord, you will despise their fleeting form.<note: Or "image">
Ps 73:21	When my heart was embittered and I felt stabbed in my kidneys,
Ps 73:22	then I was brutish and ignorant. With you I was [like] the beasts.

Ps 73:24	You will guide me with your advice, and afterward you will take me [into] honor.<note: Or "[to] glory">
Ps 73:25	Whom do I have in the heavens [except you]? And with you I have no [other] desire on earth.
Ps 73:26	My flesh and heart failed, [but] God [is] the {strength}<note: Literally "rock"> of my heart and my reward forever.
Ps 73:27	For indeed, [those] distancing themselves from you will be ruined. You destroy each who abandons you for harlotry.
Ps 73:28	But as for me, the approach to God [is] for my good. I have set the Lord Yahweh [as] my refuge, in order to tell all your works.

Ps 74:6	And now<note: According to the reading tradition (Qere)> its<note: That is, the temple's> carved works altogether they have smashed with axe and hammer.
Ps 74:7	They have set fire to your sanctuary. They have defiled to the ground, the dwelling place for your name.
Ps 74:8	They have said in their heart, "We will completely<note: Hebrew "altogether"> oppress them." They burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
Ps 74:9	We do not see our signs, and there is no longer a prophet. No one with us knows how long.
Ps 74:10	How long, O God, will [the] adversary taunt? Will [the] enemy treat your name with contempt forever?

Ps 74:20	Have regard for the covenant, because [the] dark places of [the] land are full of [the] haunts of violence.

Ps 74:23	Do not forget the sound of your adversaries, the roar of those rising up against you ascending continually.

Ps 75:6	For [it is] not from [the] east or [the] west and not from [the] south<note: Hebrew "wilderness"> [that] lifting up [comes],
Ps 75:7	rather God [is the] judge; one he brings low, and another he lifts up.
Ps 75:8	For [there is] a cup in the hand of Yahweh with<note: Hebrew "and"> wine [that] foams, fully mixed, and he pours out from this. Surely all [the] wicked of [the] land {will quaff it down [to] its dregs}. <note: Literally "they will drain, they will drink its dregs">

Ps 78:5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law<note: Hebrew torah> in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors<note: Or "fathers"> to teach to their children,
Ps 78:6	so that [the] next generation might know-- children [yet to] be born-- [that] they might rise up and tell their children,

Ps 78:20	Yes, he struck [the] rock and water flowed and streams gushed out, [but] can he also give food or provide meat for his people?"
Ps 78:21	Therefore Yahweh heard and he was very angry, and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and [his] anger also rose up against Israel,
Ps 78:22	because they did not believe God, and they did not trust his salvation.
Ps 78:23	Nevertheless, he commanded [the] skies above and opened [the] doors of heaven,
Ps 78:24	and rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven.
Ps 78:25	Humankind ate [the] bread of {angels}.<note: Literally "mighty ones"> He sent them food [enough] to be satisfied.
Ps 78:26	He caused [the] east wind to blow in the heavens and drove along [the] south wind by his strength.
Ps 78:27	Then he rained meat on them like dust, even winged birds<note: Hebrew "bird"> like [the] sand of [the] seas.
Ps 78:28	He caused [them] to fall in the midst of his camp, all around his dwellings.
Ps 78:29	So they ate and were well filled, and he brought about [what] they craved.
Ps 78:30	They had not yet turned aside from their craving, [while] their food [was] still in their mouth,
Ps 78:31	the anger of God rose against them, and he killed some of the stoutest of them, even the young men of Israel he caused to bow down [in death].
Ps 78:32	In spite of all this they sinned further and did not believe his wonders.
Ps 78:33	And he consumed their days with futility <note: Or "he ended their days like a breath"> their years with terror.<note: Or "and their years suddenly">
Ps 78:34	When he killed [some of] them, then they sought him, and repented and earnestly sought God.
Ps 78:35	And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and God Most High their redeemer.
Ps 78:36	But they enticed him with their mouth and lied to him with their tongue.
Ps 78:37	For their heart was not steadfast with him, nor were they faithful to his covenant.
Ps 78:38	But he [was] compassionate; he pardoned<note: Or "covered," or "atoned for"> [their] guilt and did not destroy [them]. And many [times] he turned back his anger and did not stir up all his wrath,
Ps 78:39	for he remembered that they [were] flesh, a passing wind that does not return.
Ps 78:40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and vexed him in [the] wasteland!
Ps 78:41	So they again tested God and distressed<note: Or perhaps, "pressed to the limit"> the Holy One of Israel.
Ps 78:42	And they did not remember his {power}<note: Literally "hand"> {when}<note: Literally "the day that"> he redeemed them from the enemy,
Ps 78:43	how he performed<note: Hebrew "set"> his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the region of Zoan,
Ps 78:44	when he turned their rivers<note: Normally the word for the Nile, with the plural here suggesting perhaps it and its canals> to blood so they could not drink [from] their streams.
Ps 78:45	He sent among them flies that devoured them and frogs that destroyed them.
Ps 78:46	And he gave their crop to the locusts and their labor to the locust.<note: Two different words translated "locusts">
Ps 78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with sleet.<note: The word for "sleet" is only used here, and the translation is a guess based on context>
Ps 78:48	He also handed their cattle over to the hail and their livestock to the lightning bolts.
Ps 78:49	He sent against them his fierce anger, rage and indignation and trouble, a band of {destroying}<note: Literally "evil"> angels.
Ps 78:50	He cleared a path for his anger. He did not spare them<note: Hebrew "their soul"> from death but handed their life over to the plague.
Ps 78:51	And he struck down all [the] firstborn in Egypt, [the] first of [their] virility in the tents of Ham.
Ps 78:52	Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them like a herd in the wilderness.
Ps 78:53	And he led them safely and they were not afraid, but the sea covered their enemies.
Ps 78:54	So he brought them to his holy territory,<note: Hebrew "border"> this mountain his right hand acquired.<note: Or "had created">
Ps 78:55	And he drove out nations before them and allocated them for an inheritance by [boundary] line, and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
Ps 78:56	But they tested and rebelled against God Most High and did not keep his statutes.
Ps 78:57	And they turned and were treacherous like their ancestors.<note: Or "fathers"> They twisted like a crooked<note: Or "deceitful"> bow.
Ps 78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and made him jealous with their images.
Ps 78:59	God heard and he was very angry and rejected Israel utterly.
Ps 78:60	So he abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, [the] tent he had placed among humankind.
Ps 78:61	And he gave his strength into captivity and his splendor into [the] hand of [the] enemy.
Ps 78:62	He also handed his people over to the sword, and he was very angry with his inheritance.
Ps 78:63	Fire devoured his young men, and his young women<note: Or "virgins"> were not praised.
Ps 78:64	His priests fell by the sword, and his widows did not weep.
Ps 78:65	Then the Lord awoke like [one who had been] asleep, [awoke] like a warrior who had been drunk with wine.<note: Or "like a warrior shouting because of wine">
Ps 78:66	And he beat back his enemies; he gave them over to perpetual scorn.
Ps 78:67	And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not chose the tribe of Ephraim,
Ps 78:68	but chose the tribe of Judah, {Mount Zion}<note: Literally "the mountain of Zion"> that he loved.
Ps 78:69	And he built his sanctuary like [the] heights, like [the] earth that he established forever.
Ps 78:70	And he chose David his servant and took him from [the] sheepfolds.
Ps 78:71	He brought him from following nursing ewes to shepherd Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.
Ps 78:72	And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skillfulness of his hands.

Ps 103:9	He does not dispute continually, nor keep [his anger] forever.
Ps 103:10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us according to our iniquities.
Ps 103:11	For as [the] heavens are high above the earth, [so] his loyal love prevails over those who fear him.
Ps 103:12	As far as east [is] from west, [so] he has removed far from us [the guilt of] our transgressions.
Ps 103:13	As a father pities<note: Or "shows compassion to"> [his] children, [so] Yahweh pities<note: Or "shows compassion to"> those who fear him.
Ps 103:14	For he knows our frame.<note: That is, how we are formed> He remembers that we [are] dust.
Ps 103:15	As for man, his days [are] like the grass. As the flower of the field, so he blossoms.
Ps 103:16	When [the] wind passes over it, it is no more, and its place knows it no longer.
Ps 103:17	But the loyal love of Yahweh [is] from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to [their] children's children,
Ps 103:18	to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his precepts.
Ps 103:19	Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
Ps 103:20	Bless Yahweh, you his angels, [you] mighty heroes who do his word by {obeying}<note: Literally "hearing"> the sound of his word.
Ps 103:21	Bless Yahweh, all you his hosts, [you] his attendants who do his will.
Ps 103:22	Bless Yahweh, all his works,<note: That is, created things> in all the places of his dominion. Bless Yahweh, O my soul.


CHAPTER 104
Ps 104:1	Bless Yahweh, O my soul. O Yahweh my God, you are very great. You clothe yourself [with] splendor and majesty,
Ps 104:2	[you] who cover [yourself] with light as [with] a garment, who stretch out [the] heavens like a tent curtain,
Ps 104:3	the one who sets beams in the waters [for] his upper chambers, who makes clouds his chariot, who rides<note: Hebrew "goes"> on [the] wings of [the] wind,
Ps 104:4	who makes his messengers [the] winds, his attendants a flame of fire.
Ps 104:5	He established [the] earth on her foundations, [so that] it will not be moved forever and ever.
Ps 104:6	You covered it with [the] deep as with a garment. [The] waters stood above [the] mountains.
Ps 104:7	At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they ran off.
Ps 104:8	They ascended [the] mountains [and] drained though the valleys to [the] place that you established<note: Or "appointed"> for them.
Ps 104:9	You set a boundary that they may not cross over, [so that] they would not return to cover the earth.
Ps 104:10	[You are] the one who sends forth springs into the valleys; they flow between [the] mountains.
Ps 104:11	They give drink for every beast of [the] field. [The] wild donkeys {quench}<note: Literally "break"> their thirst.
Ps 104:12	Along them the birds of the heavens abide. From among [the] branches they {sing}.<note: Literally "give voice">
Ps 104:13	[You are the one who] {waters}<note: Literally "give drink"> [the] mountains from his upper chambers. The earth is full<note: Or "is sated"> with the fruit of your labors:
Ps 104:14	[who] causes grass to grow for the cattle and herbs for the service of humankind, to bring forth food from the earth,
Ps 104:15	and wine [that] makes glad [the] heart of man, so that [their] faces shine from oil, and bread [that] strengthens the heart of man.
Ps 104:16	The trees of Yahweh drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted,
Ps 104:17	where birds make [their] nest. [The] stork [has] its home in [the] fir trees.
Ps 104:18	The high mountains [are] for the wild goats; [the] cliffs [are] a refuge for the rock badgers.
Ps 104:19	He made [the] moon for appointed times; [the] sun knows its [time for] setting.
Ps 104:20	You make darkness, and it is night, when<note: Hebrew "in it"> all [the] animals of the forest creep about.
Ps 104:21	The young lions [are] roaring for the prey and seeking their food from God.
Ps 104:22	[When] the sun rises, they gather together and lie down in their dens.
Ps 104:23	Humankind goes out to its work, and to its labor until evening.
Ps 104:24	How many are your works, O Yahweh; all of them you have done in wisdom. The earth is full of your creatures.
Ps 104:25	This [is] the great and {wide}<note: Literally "broad of hands"> sea, in which [are] moving animals without number, living things small and great.
Ps 104:26	There [the] ships sail. Leviathan [is there] that you formed to play with.<note: For this construction meaning "to play with," see Job 40:29 (Eng: 41:5)>
Ps 104:27	They all wait for you to give [them] their food {at the proper time}.<note: Literally "in its season">
Ps 104:28	You give to them; they gather [it]. You open your hand, they are filled with [what is] good.
Ps 104:29	You hide your face, they are terrified. You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.
Ps 104:30	You send forth your Spirit,<note: Or "breath"> they are created, and you renew the face of [the] ground.
Ps 104:31	May the glory of Yahweh endure forever. May Yahweh be glad in his works,
Ps 104:32	the one who looks at the earth and it quakes, and touches the mountains and they smoke.
Ps 104:33	I will sing to Yahweh throughout my life; I will sing praise to my God while {I remain alive}.<note: Literally "while I am still">
Ps 104:34	May my meditation be pleasing to him. I will be glad in Yahweh.
Ps 104:35	Let sinners perish completely from the earth, and [the] wicked {not remain alive}.<note: Literally "they are not still"> Bless Yahweh, O my soul. Praise Yah.<note: Hebrew hallelujah>


CHAPTER 105
Ps 105:1	Give thanks to Yahweh; proclaim his name; make known his deeds among the peoples.
Ps 105:2	Sing to him; sing praises concerning him; tell of all his wonderful works.
Ps 105:3	Boast about his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
Ps 105:4	Make supplication to Yahweh and his might; seek his face continually.
Ps 105:5	Remember his wonders that he has done, his signs and the judgments of his mouth,
Ps 105:6	O offspring of Abraham his servant, [you] descendants<note: Or "children," or "sons"> of Jacob, his chosen ones.
Ps 105:7	He [is] Yahweh our God; his judgments [are] in all the earth.
Ps 105:8	He remembers his covenant forever, [the] word [that] he commanded for a thousand generations,
Ps 105:9	that he made with Abraham, and by his oath [swore] to Isaac.
Ps 105:10	He then confirmed it to Jacob as a statute, to Israel [as] an everlasting covenant,
Ps 105:11	saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan [as] the allotment [that is] your<note: Hebrew plural> inheritance."
Ps 105:12	When they were {few in number}<note: Literally "men of number," that is, so few you could count them>-- a trifle--and [were] sojourners in it,
Ps 105:13	and they wandered about {among the nations},<note: Literally "from people to people"> from [one] kingdom to another people,
Ps 105:14	he allowed no one to oppress them, and he rebuked kings on account of them,
Ps 105:15	"Do not touch my anointed ones, nor harm my prophets."
Ps 105:16	Then he called for a famine upon the land; he broke every {supply}<note: Literally "staff"> of bread.
Ps 105:17	He sent a man on ahead of them; Joseph was sold as a slave.
Ps 105:18	They clamped<note: Hebrew "oppressed, hurt"> his feet in fetters.<note: Hebrew "fetter"> His neck<note: Hebrew nephesh can designate the life, soul, appetite, desire, or throat/neck.> went into irons.<note: Hebrew "iron">
Ps 105:19	Until [the] time his word came about, the word of Yahweh tested<note: Or "refined"> him.
Ps 105:20	[The] king sent and he freed him; [the] ruler of [the] peoples [sent] and let him loose.
Ps 105:21	He made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions,
Ps 105:22	to obligate<note: Hebrew "to bind, imprison" The LXX's "to instruct" presupposes ysr instead of 'sr, and might be correct in light of the parallelism that is fairly tight in this psalm> his officials {as he saw fit}<note: Literally "in his desire [soul]"> and teach his elders wisdom.
Ps 105:23	Then Israel came [to] Egypt, and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Ham.
Ps 105:24	And he<note: That is, God> made his people very fruitful. He also made them<note: Hebrew "him"> stronger than their<note: Hebrew "his"> enemies.
Ps 105:25	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal deceitfully against his servants.
Ps 105:26	He sent his servant Moses, together with Aaron whom he had chosen.
Ps 105:27	They set before them the words concerning his signs and portents in the land of Ham.
Ps 105:28	He sent darkness and made [it] dark, and they did not rebel against his words.
Ps 105:29	He turned their waters into blood and it killed their fish.
Ps 105:30	Their land swarmed with frogs, [even] in the chambers of their kings.
Ps 105:31	He spoke, and there came flies [and] gnats throughout all their territory.<note: Hebrew "borders">
Ps 105:32	He gave hail for their rains [and the] fire of lightning in their land.
Ps 105:33	And he struck their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their territory.
Ps 105:34	He spoke and there came locusts and young locusts without number.
Ps 105:35	And they ate up all [the] vegetation in their land, and they ate up the fruit of their ground.
Ps 105:36	And he struck down all [the] firstborn in their land, [the] first of all their virility.
Ps 105:37	Then he brought them out with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
Ps 105:38	Egypt was glad when they departed, because the fear of them<note: That is, Israel> had fallen upon them.
Ps 105:39	He spread out a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light at night.
Ps 105:40	They<note: Hebrew "He"> asked, and he brought quail, and satisfied them with [the] bread of heaven.
Ps 105:41	He opened [the] rock and waters flowed; they coursed<note: Or "surged"> through the dry places [like] a river.
Ps 105:42	For he remembered his holy {promise};<note: Literally "word"> [he remembered] Abraham his servant.
Ps 105:43	And [so] he brought out his people with joy, his chosen ones with rejoicing.
Ps 105:44	And he gave to them [the] lands of [the] nations, and they inherited [the] labor of [the] peoples,
Ps 105:45	so that they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise Yah.<note: Hebrew hallelujah>


CHAPTER 106
Ps 106:1	Praise Yah.<note: Hebrew hallelujah> Give thanks to Yahweh, for [he is] good, for his loyal love [is] forever.
Ps 106:2	Who can utter the mighty deeds of Yahweh, [or] proclaim all his praise?
Ps 106:3	Blessed are [those who] observe justice, [he who] does righteousness at all times.
Ps 106:4	Remember me, O Yahweh, when [you show] favor to your people. Look after me when you deliver,
Ps 106:5	that [I] may see the good [done] your chosen ones, to be glad in the joy of your nation, to glory together with your inheritance.
Ps 106:6	We have sinned [along] with our ancestors.<note: Or "fathers"> We have committed iniquity; we have incurred guilt.
Ps 106:7	Our ancestors<note: Or "fathers"> in Egypt did not understand your wonderful works. They did not remember your many acts of loyal love, and [so] they rebelled by [the] sea at {the Red Sea}.<note: Literally "sea of reed">
Ps 106:8	Yet he saved them for the sake of his name, to make known his might.
Ps 106:9	So he rebuked {the Red Sea},<note: Literally "sea of reed"> and it dried up, and he led them through the deep as [through] a desert.
Ps 106:10	Thus he saved them from [the] hand of [the] hater and redeemed them from [the] hand of [the] enemy.
Ps 106:11	But waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.
Ps 106:12	Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
Ps 106:13	They quickly forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
Ps 106:14	And they {craved intensely}<note: Literally "craved a craving"> in the wilderness, and tested God in [the] desert.
Ps 106:15	So he gave to them their request, but he sent leanness into their souls.<note: Hebrew "soul" or "inner self">
Ps 106:16	And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, [and] of Aaron, the holy one of Yahweh.
Ps 106:17	[The] earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and it covered over the gang of Abiram.
Ps 106:18	Also fire burned in their assembly; [the] flame devoured [the] wicked.
Ps 106:19	They made a calf at Horeb and bowed down to a cast image.
Ps 106:20	And [so] they exchanged their glory for an image of an ox that eats grass.
Ps 106:21	They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
Ps 106:22	wonders in the land of Ham, awesome deeds by {the Red Sea}.<note: Literally "sea of reed">
Ps 106:23	So he said he would exterminate them, had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to reverse his wrath from destroying [them].
Ps 106:24	Then they refused the desirable land; they did not believe his word,
Ps 106:25	but grumbled in their tents. They did not obey the voice of Yahweh.
Ps 106:26	So {he made an oath}<note: Literally "he lifted his hand," an act accompanying an oath> against them, to make them drop in the wilderness,
Ps 106:27	and to disperse<note: Or "let drop"> their {descendants}<note: Literally "seed"> among the nations and to scatter them among the lands.
Ps 106:28	They also attached themselves to Baal of Peor, and they ate sacrifices offered to [the] dead.<note: Hebrew "sacrifices of dead">
Ps 106:29	Thus they provoked to anger by their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
Ps 106:30	Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and [so] the plague was stopped,
Ps 106:31	and it was reckoned to him as righteousness {throughout all generations}.<note: Literally "for a generation and a generation">
Ps 106:32	They also angered [God] at the waters of Meribah, and it went badly for Moses on account of them,
Ps 106:33	because they rebelled against his Spirit,<note: A slightly different verbal form yields "they embittered his spirit"> and he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips.
Ps 106:34	They did not exterminate the peoples, as Yahweh had commanded them, <note: Hebrew "said to them">
Ps 106:35	but they mingled with the nations and learned their works,
Ps 106:36	and served their idols, which became<note: Hebrew "and they became"> a snare to them.
Ps 106:37	They even sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons,
Ps 106:38	and they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and [so] the land was defiled with the blood.<note: Hebrew "bloods," that is, bloodshed>
Ps 106:39	And they became unclean by their works, and were unfaithful in their deeds.
Ps 106:40	So Yahweh's anger burned against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.
Ps 106:41	Then he gave them into [the] hand of [the] nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
Ps 106:42	And their enemies oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.
Ps 106:43	Many times he delivered them, but they rebelled in their counsel, and were brought low by their iniquity.
Ps 106:44	Yet he looked upon their distress when he heard their cry.
Ps 106:45	And he remembered his covenant with them, and relented based on the abundance of his loyal love.
Ps 106:46	And he {let them find compassion}<note: Literally "gave them to [have] mercies"> before all their captors.
Ps 106:47	Save us, O Yahweh our God, and gather us from the nations, so that [we may] give thanks to your holy name [and] boast in your praise.
Ps 106:48	Blessed [is] Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise Yah.<note: Hebrew hallelujah>


CHAPTER 107
Ps 107:1	Give thanks to Yahweh, for [he is] good, for his loyal love [is] forever.
Ps 107:2	Let the redeemed of Yahweh declare<note: Hebrew "say"> [it], [those] whom he has redeemed from [the] hand of [the] enemy
Ps 107:3	and gathered from [the] lands, from east and from west, from north and from south.<note: Hebrew "sea" (yam), which usually means "west" in a listing of directions. The word "south" is expected (Hebrew yamin). Either the MT was corrupted early (along with Isa 49:12; the LXX reads "sea" in both) or it looks to the bodies of waters to the south (see also the Targum)>
Ps 107:4	They wandered in the wilderness, in a desert. They could find no way<note: The MT reads "way" with the previous line.> to a city to inhabit.
Ps 107:5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul grew faint within them.
Ps 107:6	Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble. He delivered them from their distresses
Ps 107:7	and led them by a straight way to get to a city to inhabit.
Ps 107:8	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love, and his wonderful deeds for [the] children of humankind,
Ps 107:9	for he satisfies [the] longing soul,<note: Thirst is perhaps in view> and [the] hungry soul he fills with good.
Ps 107:10	[Those who] sat in darkness and gloom, prisoners of misery and iron--
Ps 107:11	because they rebelled against the words of God and spurned the counsel of the Most High,
Ps 107:12	he therefore humbled their heart with trouble. They stumbled and there was no helper.
Ps 107:13	Then they called to Yahweh for help in their trouble; he saved them from their distresses.
Ps 107:14	He brought them out of darkness and gloom, and tore off their bonds.
Ps 107:15	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love and his wonderful deeds for [the] children of humankind,
Ps 107:16	for he shatters [the] doors of bronze, and cuts through [the] bars of iron.
Ps 107:17	Fools, because of their rebellious way and their iniquities, were afflicted.
Ps 107:18	Their soul abhorred all food, and they approached [the] gates of death.
Ps 107:19	Then they called to Yahweh for help in their trouble. He saved them from their distresses.
Ps 107:20	He sent his word and healed them, and he delivered [them] from their pits.<note: This word is only found elsewhere in Lam 4:20 with the sense of "traps">
Ps 107:21	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love, and his wonderful deeds for [the] children of humankind,
Ps 107:22	and let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his works with rejoicing.
Ps 107:23	[Those who] went down to the sea into ships, doing business on [the] {high seas},<note: Literally "many waters">
Ps 107:24	they saw the works of Yahweh, and his wonderful deeds in [the] deep.
Ps 107:25	For he spoke and raised up a stormy wind, and it whipped up its waves.
Ps 107:26	They rose to the heavens; they plunged to [the] depths. Their soul melted in their calamity.
Ps 107:27	They reeled and staggered like a drunkard, and {they were at their wits' end}.<note: Literally "all their wisdom was swallowed up">
Ps 107:28	Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distresses.
Ps 107:29	He made [the] storm be still and their waves became calm.
Ps 107:30	Then they were glad because they grew silent, so he guided them to their desired harbor.
Ps 107:31	Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love and his wonderful deeds for [the] children of humankind,
Ps 107:32	and let them exalt him in [the] congregation of [the] people, and praise him in [the] assembly of [the] elders.
Ps 107:33	He turns rivers into a wilderness and springs of water into thirsty ground,
Ps 107:34	a fruitful land into a salty place, because of the evil of its inhabitants.
Ps 107:35	He turns a wilderness into a pool of water and a dry land into springs of water.
Ps 107:36	And he settles [the] hungry there, so that they may establish a city to inhabit,
Ps 107:37	and sow fields and plant vineyards, {that they may yield fruit at harvest}.<note: Hebrew "and make a fruit of produce">
Ps 107:38	And he blesses them and they multiply greatly, and he does not let their cattle become few.
Ps 107:39	When they become few and they are bent down from [the] oppression of calamity and grief,
Ps 107:40	[he] pours contempt on princes and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
Ps 107:41	But he protects<note: The sense is that of making something inaccessibly high, like a fortress> [the] needy from misery, and he makes [their] families like a flock.
Ps 107:42	[The] upright see [it] and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
Ps 107:43	Whoever [is] wise, then let him observe these [things], and let them consider Yahweh's acts of loyal love.


CHAPTER 108
Ps 108:title	A song. A psalm of David.<note: The Hebrew Bible counts the superscription as the first verse of the psalm; the English verse number is reduced by one>
Ps 108:1	My heart [is] steadfast, O God. I will sing and give praise, even [with] my glory.
Ps 108:2	Awake, harp and lyre. I will awake [the] dawn.<note: Or "I will awake at dawn">
Ps 108:3	I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Yahweh; I will give you praise among the nations,
Ps 108:4	because your loyal love [is] great above [the] heavens, and your faithfulness [reaches] to [the] clouds.
Ps 108:5	Be exalted above [the] heavens, O God, and [let] your glory [be] above all the earth,
Ps 108:6	so that your beloved ones may be rescued. Save by your right hand and answer me.
Ps 108:7	God has spoken in his holiness, "I will exult, I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the valley of Succoth.
Ps 108:8	Gilead [is] mine. Manasseh [is] mine. And Ephraim [is] the {helmet for}<note: Literally "protection of"> my head. Judah [is] my scepter;<note: Or "commander's rod">
Ps 108:9	Moab [is] my washing pot. Over Edom I will cast my sandal; Over Philistia I will shout in triumph."
Ps 108:10	Who will bring me to [the] fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Ps 108:11	Have you not rejected us, O God, and not gone out with our armies, O God?
Ps 108:12	Give us help against [the] enemy, for the help of humankind [is] futile.
Ps 108:13	Through God we will do valiantly,<note: Hebrew "do might"> and [it is] he [who] will tread down our enemies.


CHAPTER 109
Ps 109:title	For the [music] director. A psalm of David.<note: The Hebrew Bible counts the superscription as the first verse of the psalm>
Ps 109:1	O God of my praise, do not keep silent,
Ps 109:2	for {wicked and deceitful mouths}<note: Literally "a wicked mouth and a deceitful mouth"> have opened against me. They speak to me with a lying tongue.
Ps 109:3	They also surround me with words of hate, and fight me without cause.
Ps 109:4	In return for my love they accuse me, though I [am in] prayer.<note: Or perhaps "I [have] a plea [of innocence]">
Ps 109:5	So they inflicted evil against me in return for good and hatred in return for my love.
Ps 109:6	Appoint over him a wicked [man], and let an accuser stand at his right [hand].
Ps 109:7	When he is judged, let him come out guilty, and let his prayer<note: Or perhaps "plea [of innocence]"> become as sin.
Ps 109:8	Let his days be few; let another take his office.
Ps 109:9	Let his children be orphans, and his wife a widow,
Ps 109:10	and let his children wander aimlessly and beg, and let them plead from their ruins.
Ps 109:11	Let [the] creditor seize all that [is] his, and let strangers plunder his property.
Ps 109:12	Let there be none [who] extend to him loyal love, nor any who pities his orphans.
Ps 109:13	Let his descendants<note: Or "posterity"; Hebrew is singular> be cut off. Let their name be blotted out in [the] next generation.
Ps 109:14	Let the iniquity of his ancestors<note: Or "fathers"> be remembered before Yahweh, and let the sin of his mother not be blotted out.
Ps 109:15	Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off their<note: That is, the family> memory from [the] earth,
Ps 109:16	because he did not remember to show loyal love, but he pursued anyone,<note: Hebrew "a man"> poor or needy or brokenhearted, to slay [them].
Ps 109:17	Because he loved cursing, let it come [upon] him. Because he did not delight in blessing, let it be far from him.
Ps 109:18	Because he wore a curse as his robe, let it enter {his body}<note: Literally "his inward part"> like water, and into his bones like oil.
Ps 109:19	May it be for him like a garment [in which] he wraps, and a belt {he continually wears}.<note: Literally "continually he girds it">
Ps 109:20	Let this [be] the punishment for my accusers from Yahweh, even those who speak evil against my life.
Ps 109:21	But you, O Yahweh my Lord, deal with me for your name's sake. Because your loyal love [is] good, deliver me,
Ps 109:22	for I [am] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
Ps 109:23	Like a lengthening shadow I am passing away; I am shaken off like a locust.
Ps 109:24	My knees {buckle}<note: Literally "stumble"> from fasting, and my body grows lean without fat.
Ps 109:25	And [so] I am a disgrace to them; [when] they see me, they shake their heads.<note: Hebrew "head">
Ps 109:26	Help me, O Yahweh my God; save me according to your loyal love,
Ps 109:27	that they may know that this [is] your hand, [that] you, O Yahweh, you have done it.
Ps 109:28	Let them curse, but you bless. [When] they arise, let them be put to shame, that your servant may be glad.
Ps 109:29	Let my accusers put on disgrace, and let them cover [themselves] with their shame as with a robe.
Ps 109:30	I will give thanks to Yahweh exceedingly with my mouth, and in [the] midst of many I will praise him,
