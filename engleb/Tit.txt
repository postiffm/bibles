TITUS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 1
Titus 1:1	Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of the chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth that [is] according to godliness,
Titus 1:2	in the hope of eternal life which God, who does not lie, promised before eternal ages,
Titus 1:3	but at the proper time has disclosed his message in the proclamation [with] which I was entrusted according to the command of God our Savior,
Titus 1:4	to Titus, [my] true child according to a common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. 

Titus 1:5	On account of this, I left you behind in Crete, in order that what remains may be set in order and you may appoint elders in every town, as I ordered you.
Titus 1:6	If anyone is blameless, [the] husband of one wife, having faithful<note: Or "believing"> children, not {accused of dissipation}<note: Literally "with an accusation of dissipation"> or rebellious.
Titus 1:7	For it is necessary [for] the overseer to be blameless as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain,
Titus 1:8	but hospitable, loving what is good, prudent, just, devout, self-controlled,
Titus 1:9	holding fast to the faithful message according to the teaching, in order that he may be able both to exhort with sound instruction and to reprove those who speak against [it]. 

Titus 1:10	For there are many rebellious [people], idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
Titus 1:11	whom it is necessary to silence, whoever are ruining whole families [by]<note: *Here "[by]" is supplied as a component of the participle ("teaching") which is understood as means> teaching [things] which must not be [taught] for the sake of dishonest gain.
Titus 1:12	A certain one of them, [one of] their own prophets, has said, "Cretans [are] always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
Titus 1:13	This testimony is true, for which reason reprove them severely, in order that they may be sound in the faith,
Titus 1:14	not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of people who turn away from the truth.
Titus 1:15	To the pure all [things] [are] pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing [is] pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled.
Titus 1:16	They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny [him], [because they]<note: *Here "[because]" is supplied as a component of the participle ("are") which is understood as causal> are detestable and disobedient, and unfit for every good deed. 


CHAPTER 2
Titus 2:1	But you, speak [the things] which are fitting for sound instruction.
Titus 2:2	Older men are to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, [and] in endurance.
Titus 2:3	Older women likewise [are to be] reverent in [their] behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,
Titus 2:4	in order that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands [and to] love their children,
Titus 2:5	[to be] self-controlled, pure, busy at home, good, being subject to their own husbands, in order that the word of God may not be slandered.
Titus 2:6	Likewise, exhort the young men to be self-controlled,
Titus 2:7	concerning everything showing yourself [to be] an example of good deeds, in your teaching [demonstrating] soundness, dignity,
Titus 2:8	[a] sound message beyond reproach, in order that {an opponent}<note: Literally "one from [the] opposed"> may be put to shame, [because he]<note: *Here "[because]" is supplied as a component of the participle ("has") which is understood as causal> has nothing bad to say concerning us. 

Titus 2:9	Slaves must be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not to talk back,
Titus 2:10	not stealing, but demonstrating all good faith, in order that they may do credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything.
Titus 2:11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people,
Titus 2:12	training us in order that, denying impiety and worldly desires, we may live self-controlled and righteously and godly in the present age,
Titus 2:13	looking forward to the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
Titus 2:14	who gave himself for us, in order that he might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good deeds.
Titus 2:15	Speak these [things] and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you. 


CHAPTER 3
Titus 3:1	Remind them to be subject to the rulers [and] to the authorities, to obey, to be prepared for every good work,
Titus 3:2	to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all courtesy to all people.
Titus 3:3	For we also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, enslaved to various desires and pleasures, spending our lives in wickedness and envy, despicable, hating one another.
Titus 3:4	But when the kindness and love for mankind of God our Savior appeared,
Titus 3:5	he saved us, not by deeds of righteousness that we have done, but because of his mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
Titus 3:6	whom he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
Titus 3:7	so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 

Titus 3:8	The saying [is] trustworthy, and I want you to insist concerning these [things], so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people.
Titus 3:9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and contentions and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and fruitless.
Titus 3:10	Reject a divisive person after a first and second admonition,
Titus 3:11	knowing that such a person is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned. 

Titus 3:12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make haste to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Titus 3:13	Diligently send on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that {they may lack nothing}<note: Literally "nothing may lack to them">.
Titus 3:14	But also our [people] must learn to engage in good deeds for necessary needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.
Titus 3:15	All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace [be] with all of you.
