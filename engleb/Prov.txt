CHAPTER 1
Pr 1:1	Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
Pr 1:2	To know wisdom and instruction, to understand sayings of understanding,
Pr 1:3	to gain {insightful instruction},<note: Literally "the instruction of insight"> righteousness and justice and equity,
Pr 1:4	to give shrewdness<note: Or "cleverness," or "prudence"> to the simple, knowledge and purpose<note: Or "plan"> to the young,
Pr 1:5	may the wise hear and increase learning, and the one who understands gain direction,<note: Or "guidance">
Pr 1:6	to understand a proverb and an expression, words of wisdom and their riddles.
Pr 1:7	Fear of Yahweh [is the] beginning of knowledge; wisdom and instruction, fools despise.

Pr 1:8	My child, may you keep<note: Or "obey," or "hear"> your father's instruction, and do not reject your mother's teachings,
Pr 1:9	for they [are] a garland of favor for your head, and pendants for your neck.
Pr 1:10	My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
Pr 1:11	If they say, "Come with us! We shall lie in wait for blood; we shall ambush the innocent without cause.<note: Or "wantonly," or "for nothing">
Pr 1:12	Like Sheol,<note: A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld> we will swallow them alive and whole, {like those who descend to the pit}.<note: Literally "like the descenders of a pit">
Pr 1:13	We shall find all precious wealth, we shall fill our houses [with] booty,
Pr 1:14	you shall throw your lot in our midst, there will be one purse for all of us."
Pr 1:15	My child, do not walk in their way.<note: Or "on their road"> Keep your foot from their paths,
Pr 1:16	for their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed blood,
Pr 1:17	for "in vain<note: Or "without cause," or "for nothing"> is the net scattered, in the sight of any {winged bird}."<note: Literally "bird of wing">
Pr 1:18	They lie in wait for their [own] blood. They ambush their [own] lives.
Pr 1:19	Thus are the ways of all who are greedy [for] gain-- it will take the life of its possessors.

Pr 1:20	Wisdom calls out in the streets, in the squares she raises her voice.
Pr 1:21	On a {busy corner}<note: Literally "head of commotion," or "head of stirring, bustling"> she cries out, at the entrances of the gates in the city, she speaks her sayings:
Pr 1:22	"{How long},<note: Literally "Until when"> O simple ones, will you love simplicity? And [how long] will scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?
Pr 1:23	May you turn to my argument!<note: Or "turn at my reproach"> Behold, I shall pour out my spirit upon you; I will make my words known to you.
Pr 1:24	Because I called out and you refused me, I stretched out my hand, yet there is none who heeds.
Pr 1:25	You have ignored all my counsel, and my reproof you are not willing [to accept].
Pr 1:26	I will also laugh at your calamity;<note: Or "downfall"> I will mock when panic<note: Or "dread, fear"> comes [upon] you.
Pr 1:27	When your panic comes like a storm, and your calamity arrives like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you,
Pr 1:28	then they will call<note: Or "cry out [to]"> me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but not find me.
Pr 1:29	Since they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,
Pr 1:30	they were not willing [to accept] my counsel, they despised all my reproof.
Pr 1:31	They shall eat from the fruit of their way, and they shall be sated from their own schemes,
Pr 1:32	for the waywardness of the simple ones will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
Pr 1:33	Whoever listens to me will dwell in security and rest securely<note: Or "be at ease, peace"> from dread and disaster."


CHAPTER 2
Pr 2:1	My child, if you will receive<note: Or "take, seize"> my sayings, and hide my commands with you,
Pr 2:2	[in order] to incline your ear toward wisdom, [then] you shall apply your heart to understanding.
Pr 2:3	For if you cry out for understanding,<note: Or "call to understanding"> [if] you lift<note: Or "carry, give"> your voice for insight,
Pr 2:4	if you seek her like silver and search her out {like treasure},<note: Literally "like the treasures">
Pr 2:5	then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and the knowledge of God you will find.
Pr 2:6	For Yahweh will give wisdom; from his mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.
Pr 2:7	For the upright, he stores<note: Or "hides, keeps"> sound judgment, a shield for those who walk uprightly,
Pr 2:8	[in order] to guard paths of justice and keep<note: Or "preserve, guard, watch"> the way of his faithful [ones].
Pr 2:9	Then you will understand righteousness and justice and uprightness--every good course--
Pr 2:10	for wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul.<note: Or "inner self">
Pr 2:11	Discretion will watch over you; understanding will protect you,
Pr 2:12	[in order] to deliver you from the way of evil,<note: Or "evildoer"> from a man who speaks devious things--
Pr 2:13	those who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in ways of darkness,
Pr 2:14	those who are happy to do evil, [for] they delight in [the] deviousness of evil,
Pr 2:15	{who are crooked in their ways},<note: Literally "that [in] their ways are crooked"> and devious in their paths;
Pr 2:16	[in order] to deliver you from a strange woman, from a foreign woman [who] flatters<note: Or "makes smooth"> [with] her sayings,
Pr 2:17	she who forsakes the partner of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God,
Pr 2:18	for her house sinks to death, and to the dead<note: Or "Rephaim"> are her paths.
Pr 2:19	[Of] all who go to her, none shall return, nor do they reach paths of life.
Pr 2:20	So that you will walk on the road of those who are good, and the paths of those who are righteous you shall keep.
Pr 2:21	For those who are upright will dwell [in the] land,<note: Or "earth"> and those who are blameless<note: Or "innocent"> will remain in it.
Pr 2:22	And those who are wicked will be cut off from the land, and those who are treacherous will be uprooted from it.


CHAPTER 3
Pr 3:1	My child, do not forget my instruction, and may your heart guard my commands.
Pr 3:2	For length of days, years of life, and peace they<note: That is, "my commands" (3:1)> shall add to you.
Pr 3:3	May loyal love<note: Or "kindness, mercy"> and truth not forsake you; bind them around your neck, write them upon your heart.
Pr 3:4	And you shall find favor and good sense<note: Or "understanding, prudence"> in the eyes of God and humankind.
Pr 3:5	{Trust Yahweh}<note: Literally "trust toward Yahweh"> with all your heart; do not lean toward your own understanding.
Pr 3:6	In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will straighten your paths.
Pr 3:7	Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Yahweh and retreat from evil.
Pr 3:8	There shall be healing for your {flesh},<note: Literally "navel"> and refreshment for your body.
Pr 3:9	Honor Yahweh from your substance,<note: Or "wealth, property"> and from the firstfruits of all that will come to you,
Pr 3:10	and your barns shall be full of plenty, and your vats shall burst [with] new wine.

Pr 3:11	Do not despise the discipline of Yahweh, my child. Do not be weary of his reproof
Pr 3:12	because whomever Yahweh will love, he will rebuke, as a father delights in his son.
Pr 3:13	Happy [is] {the one}<note: Literally "a man"> who finds wisdom, and one who obtains understanding.
Pr 3:14	For her<note: Or "its"; both "wisdom" and "understanding" are feminine nouns and can be read as either "she" or "it"> income is better than the income of silver, and her revenue than [that of] gold.
Pr 3:15	She is more precious than rubies, and all your desires shall not compare with her.
Pr 3:16	Length of days [is] in her right hand; in her left hand [are] riches and honor.
Pr 3:17	Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, and all her paths [are] peace.
Pr 3:18	She is a tree of life for those who seize her; those who take hold of her are considered happy.

Pr 3:19	Yahweh in wisdom founded the earth; he established the heavens in understanding.
Pr 3:20	With his knowledge, depths broke open, and clouds dropped dew.
Pr 3:21	My child, may they<note: Grammatically, "they" most likely refers to clouds (3:20). In context, "they" may refer to wisdom and understanding (3:13).> not escape from your {sight};<note: Literally "eyes"> may you keep sound wisdom and prudence.
Pr 3:22	They shall be life for your soul<note: Or "inner self"> and adornment<note: Or "favor"> for your neck.
Pr 3:23	Then you will walk in the confidence of your ways, and your foot will not stumble.
Pr 3:24	If you sit down, you will not panic,<note: Or "fear, dread"> and [if] you lie down, then your sleep shall be sweet.
Pr 3:25	Do not be afraid of sudden panic,<note: Or "fear, dread"> or the storm of wickedness that will come.
Pr 3:26	Yahweh will be {your confidence}<note: Literally "in your confidence"> and guard your foot from capture.
Pr 3:27	Do not withhold good from its owner<note: Or "lord"> when it is in the power of your hand to do.
Pr 3:28	Do not say to your neighbor, "Go and return and tomorrow I will give [it]," {when it is with you}.<note: Literally "and there is with you">
Pr 3:29	Do not plot harm against your neighbor [who] dwells in confidence beside you.
Pr 3:30	Do not quarrel with anyone without cause, when he did not do you harm.
Pr 3:31	Do not envy a man of violence, and do not choose any of his ways,
Pr 3:32	for he who is perverse [is] an abomination of Yahweh, but those who are upright [are] his confidence.
Pr 3:33	The curse of Yahweh [is] on the house of the wicked, and the abode of the righteous ones he blesses.
Pr 3:34	With those who scorn, he is scornful, but to those who are humble, he gives favor.
Pr 3:35	They will inherit the honor of the wise, but stubborn fools, disgrace.


CHAPTER 4
Pr 4:1	Children, listen [to the] instruction of a father, and be attentive [in order] to know insight.
Pr 4:2	For I have given you good instruction; do not forsake my teaching.
Pr 4:3	When I was a son to my father, tender and alone before my mother,
Pr 4:4	he taught me and said to me, "May your heart hold fast [to] my words; guard my commandments and live.
Pr 4:5	Get wisdom and insight; do not forget and do not turn from the sayings of my mouth.
Pr 4:6	Do not forsake her--then she will guard you; love her and she will keep you.
Pr 4:7	The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! With all [that is in] your possession, gain insight.
Pr 4:8	Cherish her and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.
Pr 4:9	She will give a garland for your head; she shall bestow a crown of glory upon you."

Pr 4:10	Listen, my child, take my sayings, and [the] years of your life shall be great.
Pr 4:11	In the way of wisdom I have instructed you; I have led you in the path of uprightness.
Pr 4:12	{When you walk},<note: Literally "In your walking"> your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble.
Pr 4:13	Seize the instruction! Do not let go! Guard her, for she is your life.
Pr 4:14	In the path of the wicked do not go; do not walk in the way of those who do evil.
Pr 4:15	Avoid it; do not transgress it; turn away from it and pass by.
Pr 4:16	For they will not sleep if they have not done wrong, and they are robbed of their sleep if they do not cause stumbling.
Pr 4:17	For they ate the bread of wickedness, and they drank the wine of violence.
Pr 4:18	But the path of the righteous ones [is] like the light of dawn, leading and shining until the day {is full}.<note: Literally "[is] correct">
Pr 4:19	The way of the wicked ones [is] like deep darkness; they do not know what they stumble over.

Pr 4:20	My child, be attentive to my words; to my sayings incline your ear.
Pr 4:21	May they not escape from your {sight};<note: Literally "eyes"> keep them in [the] midst of your heart.
Pr 4:22	For they are life to those who find them and healing {to the entire body}.<note: Literally "for all his flesh">
Pr 4:23	With all vigilance, keep your heart, for from it [comes] the source<note: Or "extremity"> of life.
Pr 4:24	Remove from yourself {deceitful speech},<note: Literally "crookedness of mouth"> and abolish {devious talk}<note: Literally "deviousness of lips"> from yourself.
Pr 4:25	May your eyes look forward<note: Or "opposite"> and your gaze be straight before you.
Pr 4:26	May the path of your foot be balanced and all your ways be sure.
Pr 4:27	Do not swerve right or left; remove your foot from evil.


CHAPTER 5
Pr 5:1	My child, be attentive to my wisdom, and to my understanding incline your ear;
Pr 5:2	[in order] to keep prudence, and knowledge will guard your lips.
Pr 5:3	For the lips of the strange woman will drip honey, and smoother than oil is her mouth.<note: Or "palate">
Pr 5:4	But her end is bitter as the wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Pr 5:5	Her feet go down [to] death; her steps take hold [of] Sheol.<note: A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld>
Pr 5:6	She does not observe<note: Or "examine, weigh"> the path of life; her ways wander, [and] she does not know [it].

Pr 5:7	Now, O children, listen to me; do not depart from the sayings of my mouth.
Pr 5:8	Keep your paths far from her, and do not go near to the door of her house,
Pr 5:9	lest you give your honor to the others, and your years to the merciless,
Pr 5:10	lest strangers take [their] fill of your strength, and your labors [go] to the house of a foreigner,
Pr 5:11	and you groan at your end, when your flesh and body are consumed,
Pr 5:12	and say "How I hated discipline, and I despised reproof!"
Pr 5:13	and "I did not listen to the voice of my teachers, and I did not incline my ear to my instructors!
Pr 5:14	I was almost at utter<note: Or "all, every, whole"> ruin<note: Or "evil"> in the midst of the assembly and congregation."
Pr 5:15	Drink water from your [own] cistern and flowing waters from inside your own well.
Pr 5:16	Shall your springs be scattered outward? In the streets, [shall there be] streams of water?
Pr 5:17	May they be yours alone, and not for strangers [who are] with you.
Pr 5:18	May your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife<note: Or "woman"> of your youth.
Pr 5:19	[She is] a deer of love and a doe of grace; may her breasts satisfy you {always};<note: Literally "at all time"> by her love may you be intoxicated continually.
Pr 5:20	Why should you be intoxicated, my child, by a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
Pr 5:21	For before the eyes of Yahweh [are] {human ways},<note: Literally "the ways of man/humankind"> and all his paths he examines.
Pr 5:22	His iniquities shall ensnare him, the evildoer, and in the vanity of his sin he shall be caught.
Pr 5:23	He shall die {for lack of}<note: Literally "with there is no"> discipline, and in the greatness of his folly he shall be lost.


CHAPTER 6
Pr 6:1	My child, if you have pledged to your neighbor, [if] you have bound {yourself}<note: Literally "palms of your hands"> to the stranger,
Pr 6:2	[if] you are snared by the sayings of your mouth, [if] you are caught by the sayings of your mouth,
Pr 6:3	do this, then, my child, and save yourself, for you have come into {the palm of your neighbor's hand}:<note: Literally "the palm of the hand of your neighbor"> Go, humble yourself, plead with your neighbor.
Pr 6:4	Do not give sleep to your eyes, or slumber to your eyelids.
Pr 6:5	Save yourself like a gazelle from a hand, or like a bird from the hand of a fowler.

Pr 6:6	Go to the ant, lazy! Consider its ways and be wise.
Pr 6:7	It has no chief, officer, or ruler.
Pr 6:8	In the summer, it prepares its food; in the harvest, it gathers its sustenance.
Pr 6:9	How long will you lie down, lazy? When will you rise up from your sleep?
Pr 6:10	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands for rest--
Pr 6:11	like a {robber}<note: Literally "one who walks," that is, a vagabond> shall your poverty come, and what you lack like an armed man.

Pr 6:12	A worthless man, an evil man, goes around with {deceitful speech}.<note: Literally "crookedness of mouth">
Pr 6:13	Winking in his eye, shuffling in his foot, pointing in his fingers,
Pr 6:14	perversion in his heart, he devises evil; at all times he will send out discord.<note: Or "quarrels">
Pr 6:15	Upon {such a man},<note: Literally "thus"> suddenly shall his calamity come; in a moment he will be damaged and there is no healing.<note: Or "repair">

Pr 6:16	There are six [things] Yahweh hates, and seven [things are] abominations of his soul:<note: Or "inner self">
Pr 6:17	haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
Pr 6:18	a devising heart, plans of deception, feet that hurry to run to evil,<note: Hebrew "the evil">
Pr 6:19	a false witness who breathes lies and sends out discord<note: Or "quarrels"> between brothers.

Pr 6:20	My child, keep [the] commandment of your father, and do not disregard [the] instruction of your mother.
Pr 6:21	Bind them on your heart continually; tie them upon your neck.
Pr 6:22	{When you walk},<note: Literally "In your walking"> she<note: That is, "commandment" and "instruction"> will lead you, {When you lie down},<note: Literally "In your lying down"> she will watch over you, and [when] you awake, she will converse [with] you.
Pr 6:23	For [like] a lamp [is] a commandment, and instruction [is] light, and the way of life<note: Hebrew "lives"> [is the] reproof of discipline,
Pr 6:24	[in order] to preserve you from an evil woman,<note: Or "wife"> from the smoothness of [the] tongue of {an adulteress}.<note: Literally "a foreign woman">
Pr 6:25	Do not desire her beauty in your heart; may she not capture you with her eyelashes.
Pr 6:26	For [the] price of a woman, a prostitute,<note: Or "whore"> [is the] price of a loaf of bread, but the {woman belonging to a man}<note: Literally "the woman of a man"> hunts precious life.

Pr 6:27	Can a man carry fire in his lap, and his clothes not burn?
Pr 6:28	If a man walks upon the hot coals, will his feet not be burned?
Pr 6:29	Thus, he who goes to the wife of his neighbor, any who touches her shall not go unpunished.
Pr 6:30	[People] do not despise a thief when he steals to fill himself<note: Or "soul," or "inner self"> when he is hungry.
Pr 6:31	But [if] he is found, he will pay sevenfold, every possession of his house he shall give.
Pr 6:32	He who commits adultery [with] a woman lacks {sense},<note: Literally "heart"> he destroys himself<note: Or "his soul," or "his life"> who does it.
Pr 6:33	A wound and dishonor he will find, and his disgrace will not be wiped out.
Pr 6:34	For jealousy [is the] fury of a husband, and he will not show restraint on the day of revenge.
Pr 6:35	He will not accept {any compensation},<note: Literally "[the] face of any compensation"> and he will not be willing, though the bribe is large.


CHAPTER 7
Pr 7:1	My child, guard my sayings; store my commandments with you.
Pr 7:2	Keep my commands and live, and my teaching like [the] {apple of your eye}.<note: A single word meaning "pupil of the eye">
Pr 7:3	Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
Pr 7:4	Say to wisdom,<note: Hebrew "the wisdom"> "you are my sister," and you shall call insight,<note: Hebrew "the insight"> "{intimate friend}."<note: Literally "one who is known." To "know" is often a euphemism for intercourse. Therefore "intimate friend" may also be read "lover.">
Pr 7:5	[In order] to guard yourself from {an adulteress},<note: Literally "a strange woman"> from the foreigner who {makes her words smooth}.<note: Literally "causes to be smooth her words">
Pr 7:6	For at the window of my house, through my lattice, I looked down.
Pr 7:7	And I saw among the simple, I observed among the youth, a young man lacking {sense},<note: Literally "heart">
Pr 7:8	passing on the street {at}<note: Literally "at the place of"> her corner, and he takes the road [to] her house,
Pr 7:9	at twilight, at [the] day's evening, in [the] midst of night and the darkness.
Pr 7:10	Then behold! A woman [comes] to meet him [with the] garment of a prostitute<note: Or "whore"> and {a secret heart}.<note: Literally "secret of heart">
Pr 7:11	She is loud and stubborn; her feet do not stay at her house.
Pr 7:12	Now in the street, now in the square, {at}<note: Literally "at the place of"> every corner she lies in wait.
Pr 7:13	She took hold of <note: Or "strengthened"> him and kissed him. Her face was impudent, and she said to him,
Pr 7:14	"Sacrifices of peace offerings [are] upon me; {today}<note: Literally "the day"> I completed my vows.
Pr 7:15	So<note: Hebrew "thus"> I have come out to meet you, to seek your face, and I have found you.
Pr 7:16	[With] coverings I have adorned my couch, spreads of the linen of Egypt;
Pr 7:17	I have perfumed my bed [with] myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Pr 7:18	Come, let us take [our] fill of love making, until the morning let us delight in love.
Pr 7:19	For there is no man<note: Or "husband"> in his home; he has gone on a {long journey}.<note: Literally "a journey from far">
Pr 7:20	The bag of money he took in his hand, for [on] the day of the full moon he will come home."
Pr 7:21	She persuades him with the greatness of her teachings; with her smooth lips she compels him.
Pr 7:22	He goes after her suddenly; like an ox to the slaughter he goes, and like a stag to the instruction of a fool,
Pr 7:23	until an arrow pierces his {entrails},<note: Literally "heaviness," often referring to the liver> like a bird rushing into a snare, but he does not know that {it will cost him his life}.<note: Literally "it is against his life">

Pr 7:24	And now, my children, listen to me, and be attentive to the sayings of my mouth.
Pr 7:25	May your heart not turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her path.
Pr 7:26	For many slain she has laid low, and countless<note: Or "strong men"> [are] all of her killings.
Pr 7:27	The ways of Sheol<note: A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld> [are] her house, descending to chambers of death.


CHAPTER 8
Pr 8:1	Does not wisdom call, and understanding raise its voice?
Pr 8:2	{Atop the heights}<note: Literally "At a head of the heights"> beside the road, at the crossroads she stands.
Pr 8:3	Beside gates, before towns, [at the] entrance of doors, she cries out:
Pr 8:4	"To you, O {people},<note: Literally "men"> I call, and my cry is to the children of humankind.
Pr 8:5	Learn prudence, O simple ones; fools, learn {intelligence}.<note: Literally "heart">
Pr 8:6	Listen! For noble things I will speak, and upright things from the opening of my lips.
Pr 8:7	My mouth will utter truth, and wickedness [is] an abomination to my lips.
Pr 8:8	All sayings of my mouth [are] in righteousness; none of them are twisted and crooked.
Pr 8:9	All of them are straight to him who understands, and upright to those who find knowledge.
Pr 8:10	Take my teaching and not silver; may you choose knowledge rather than choice gold.
Pr 8:11	For wisdom is better than jewels, and all desires shall not compare with her.
Pr 8:12	I, wisdom, live with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.
Pr 8:13	The fear of Yahweh [is] hatred of evil, pride, and arrogance and an evil way. And I hate a mouth of perversity.
Pr 8:14	{Advice and sound judgment}<note: Literally "To/for me are advice and sound judgment"> are mine; I am understanding, {strength is mine}.<note: Literally "to/for me is strength">
Pr 8:15	By me kings reign, and rulers decree righteousness.
Pr 8:16	By me rulers rule, and nobles--all judges of righteousness.
Pr 8:17	I love {those who love me},<note: Literally "her lovers"> and those who seek me diligently shall find me.
Pr 8:18	Fortune and glory [are] with me, enduring wealth and righteousness.
Pr 8:19	My fruit is better than gold,<note: Literally "fine gold"> even refined gold, and my yield than choice silver.
Pr 8:20	In the way of righteousness I walk, in the midst of paths of justice,
Pr 8:21	[in order] to endow those who love me [with] wealth, and I will fill their treasuries.

Pr 8:22	"Yahweh possessed<note: Or "gained," or "acquired"> me, [the] first of his ways, before his acts {of old}.<note: Literally "from before" or "from then">
Pr 8:23	From eternity, I was set up from [the] first, from the beginning<note: Hebrew "beginnings"> of the earth.
Pr 8:24	When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no springs of {abounding}<note: Literally "made heavy"> water.
Pr 8:25	Before mountains had been shaped, before hills, I was brought forth.
Pr 8:26	When he had not yet made earth and fields, or the first dust of the world,
Pr 8:27	{when he established}<note: Literally "in his establishing"> the heavens, there I [was], {when he drew}<note: Literally "in his drawing"> a circle upon the face of the deep,
Pr 8:28	{when he made}<note: Literally "in his making"> skies from above, when he founded fountains of the deep,
Pr 8:29	{when he assigned}<note: Literally "in his assigning"> his limits to the sea, that waters shall not transgress his {command},<note: Literally "mouth"> {when he marked}<note: Literally "in his marking"> the foundations of the earth,
Pr 8:30	I was {beside}<note: Literally "at the place of"> him, a master workman, and I was delighting day by day, rejoicing before him {always},<note: Literally "in all [of] time">
Pr 8:31	rejoicing in the world of his earth, and my delight [was] with the children of humankind.

Pr 8:32	"And now, children, listen to me; happy [are] those who will keep my ways.
Pr 8:33	Hear teaching and be wise; do not neglect [it].
Pr 8:34	Happy [is the] person who listens to me, [in order] to keep watch at my doors day by day, [in order] to guard the frames of my entrances.
Pr 8:35	For he who finds me [is] he who finds<note: Hebrew "those who find"> life, and he obtains favor from Yahweh.
Pr 8:36	But he who misses me injures himself.<note: Or "soul," or "inner self"> All those who hate me love death."


CHAPTER 9
Pr 9:1	Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars.
Pr 9:2	She has slaughtered her slaughtering, mixed her wine, [and] also set her table.
Pr 9:3	She has sent her servant girls,<note: Or "young maidens"> she calls upon the wings of the high places of town,

Pr 24:12	if you say, "Look, we do not know this," does not he who weighs hearts perceive [it]? And he who keeps your soul,<note: Or "life," or "inner self"> he knows and will repay humankind according to his deeds.
Pr 24:13	My child, eat honey, for [it is] good, and the dripping of the honeycomb [is] sweet to your taste.
Pr 24:14	Thus know wisdom for [the sake of] your soul,<note: Or "life," or "inner self"> if you find [it], then there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
Pr 24:15	Do not lie in wait [like] an outlaw against the home of the righteous; do not do violence [to] his dwelling place.
Pr 24:16	For seven [times] the righteous will fall, but he will rise, but the wicked will be overthrown by calamity.
Pr 24:17	While your enemies are falling, do not rejoice; when he trips himself, may your heart<note: Or "mind"> not be glad
Pr 24:18	lest Yahweh see and [it] be evil in his eyes, and turn his anger away from him.
Pr 24:19	Do not fret because of the evildoers; do not envy the wicked.
Pr 24:20	For there will not be a future for the evil; the lamp of the wicked will die out.
Pr 24:21	Fear Yahweh, my son, and the king; with those who change, do not associate.
Pr 24:22	For suddenly their disaster will come, and the ruin of {both of them},<note: Literally "[the] two of them"> who knows?
Pr 24:23	These [sayings] are also for the wise: {Partiality}<note: Literally "acknowledge faces"> in judgment is not good.
Pr 24:24	Whoever says to the guilty, "You are righteous," the people will curse him; the nations will abhor him.
Pr 24:25	But they who rebuke will have delight, and upon them blessings of goodness will come.
Pr 24:26	He will kiss [the] lips, he who gives an honest answer.
Pr 24:27	Prepare your work in the street and get it ready for yourself in the field; afterward, then<note: Hebrew "and"> you shall build your house.
Pr 24:28	Do not be a witness without cause against your neighbor nor deceive with your lips.
Pr 24:29	Do not say, "Just as he has done to me, so shall I do to him; I will pay back the man according to his deed."
Pr 24:30	I passed by the field of a lazy person, and over the vineyard of a person lacking {sense};<note: Literally "heart">
Pr 24:31	and behold, it was overgrown--all of it was covered [with] thorns, its surface with nettles, and {its stone wall}<note: Literally "a wall of his/its stones"> was broken down.
Pr 24:32	Then I myself saw and my heart<note: Or "mind"> considered; I looked, and I took hold of instruction:
Pr 24:33	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands for rest,
Pr 24:34	and your poverty will come running, and your lack like an armed warrior.


CHAPTER 25
Pr 25:1	These are also proverbs of Solomon which officials of Hezekiah king of Judah copied:
Pr 25:2	The glory of God<note: Or "gods"> conceals things, but the glory of kings searches out things.
Pr 25:3	As heaven is to height and the earth is to depth, so [is] the heart<note: Or "mind"> of kings--there is no searching.
Pr 25:4	Remove the dross from silver, and it will become a vessel for the smith.
Pr 25:5	Remove the wicked before a king, and his throne will be established in righteousness.<note: Hebrew "in the righteousness">
Pr 25:6	Do not promote yourself before the king, and in the place of the great ones do not stand.
Pr 25:7	For [it is] better [that] he say to you, "Ascend here," than he humble you before a noble. What your eyes have seen,
Pr 25:8	do not hastily bring out to court, for<note: Or "lest"> what will you do at its end, when your neighbor puts you to shame?
Pr 25:9	Argue your argument with your neighbor [himself], the secret of another do not disclose,
Pr 25:10	lest he who hears shame you and your ill repute will not end.
Pr 25:11	Apples of gold in a setting of silver is a matter spoken at<note: Hebrew "on"> its proper time.
Pr 25:12	A ring of gold and an ornament of fine gold [is] a rebuke of the wise to the ear of a listener.
Pr 25:13	Like the cold of snow on a day<note: Or "at a season"> of harvest [is] a faithful messenger to those who send him, and the soul<note: Or "life," or "inner self"> of his master is refreshed.<note: Or "returned">
Pr 25:14	[Like] clouds and wind when there is no rain, [so too is] a man who boasts in a gift of deception.
Pr 25:15	{With patience}<note: Literally "With length of face"> a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue will break a bone.<note: Or "strength">
Pr 25:16	[If] you find honey, eat what is sufficient for you, lest you have your fill of it and vomit it out.
Pr 25:17	Make your foot scarce in the house of your neighbor, lest he become weary of you and hate you.
Pr 25:18	[Like] a club and sword and a sharp arrow [is] a man who bears false witness against his neighbor.
Pr 25:19	A bad tooth and a lame foot [is] the trust of a faithless person {in a time}<note: Literally "on a day"> of trouble.
Pr 25:20	[Like] one who removes a garment on a cold day, [or like] vinegar on natron,<note: A mineral salt found on dry lake beds often used as a preservative.> [is] he who sings songs to a heavy heart.
Pr 25:21	If your enemy [is] hungry, feed him bread, and if thirsty, let him drink water.
Pr 25:22	For coals of fire you will heap upon his head, and Yahweh will reward you.
Pr 25:23	The wind of the north produces rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry faces.
Pr 25:24	Better to live upon the corner of a roof than [with] a woman<note: Or "wife"> of contention and [in a] shared house.
Pr 25:25	[Like] cold water<note: Hebrew "waters"> upon a weary soul,<note: Or "life," or "inner self"> [so too is] good news from a distant place.
Pr 25:26	[Like] a muddied spring or a polluted fountain is the righteous who gives way before the wicked.
Pr 25:27	To eat much honey is not good, nor [is] seeking one's honor<note: Hebrew "their honor"> honorable.
Pr 25:28	A breached city [where] there is no wall [is like] a man who {has no}<note: Literally "there is no"> self-control for his spirit.


CHAPTER 26
Pr 26:1	Like snow in the summer and like rain at the harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool.
Pr 26:2	Like the sparrow [is] to fluttering and like the swallow [is] to flying, so an undeserved curse does not go forth.
Pr 26:3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools.
Pr 26:4	Do not answer a fool according to his folly lest you become like him--even you.
Pr 26:5	Answer a fool according to his folly, or else he will be wise in his own eyes.
Pr 26:6	[Like] cutting off feet [or] drinking violence, so [is] he who sends messages in the hand of a fool.
Pr 26:7	[Like] legs that hang limp from a lame person, so [is] a proverb in the mouth of fools.
Pr 26:8	Like binding a stone in a sling, so [is] giving honor to a fool.
Pr 26:9	[Like] a thorn that goes up in the hand of a drunkard, so [is] a proverb in the mouth of fools.
Pr 26:10	[Like] an archer who wounds everyone, so [is] he who hires a fool or he who hires passersby.
Pr 26:11	Like a dog returning to his vomit [is] a fool reverting to his folly.
Pr 26:12	[Do] you see a man wise in his own eyes? [There is more] hope for a fool than for him.
Pr 26:13	A lazy person says "A lion [is] in the road! A lion among the streets!"
Pr 26:14	The door turns on its hinge, and a lazy person on his bed.
Pr 26:15	A lazy person buries his hands in the dish; he is [too] tired to return it to his mouth.
Pr 26:16	A lazy person is wiser in his eyes than seven who answer discreetly.
Pr 26:17	Grabbing onto the ears of a dog passing by [is] one who meddles in a quarrel [that is] not his own.
Pr 26:18	Like a maniac who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,
Pr 26:19	so [is] a man who deceives his neighbor, but says "Am I not joking?"
Pr 26:20	For lack of wood, a fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling will cease.
Pr 26:21	[As] charcoal [is] to hot embers and wood [is] to fire, so a man of quarrels [is] to kindling strife.
Pr 26:22	The words of a whisperer [are] like delicious morsels, and they go down to the inner parts of the body.
Pr 26:23	[Like] {impure silver}<note: Literally "silver of impurities"> which overlays an earthen vessel, [so are] smooth lips and an evil heart<note: Or "mind">.
Pr 26:24	On his lips, an enemy will pretend, but {inside}<note: Literally "in his midst"> he will harbor deceit.
Pr 26:25	When he makes his voice gracious, do not believe him, for seven abominations [are] in his heart.
Pr 26:26	Though hatred is covered with guile, its evil will be exposed in the assembly.
Pr 26:27	He who digs a pit, in it he will fall, and he who rolls a stone, on him it will come back.
Pr 26:28	A tongue of deceit hates its victim, and a flattering mouth makes ruin.


CHAPTER 27
Pr 27:1	Do not boast {about tomorrow},<note: Literally "on the day of tomorrow"> for you do not know what the day will bring.
Pr 27:2	May another praise you and not your own mouth, a stranger and not your own lips.
Pr 27:3	Heavy [is] a stone and weighty [is] sand, but [the] provocation of a fool [is] heavier than both of them.
Pr 27:4	Cruel [is] wrath and overwhelming [is] anger, but who will stand before jealousy?
Pr 27:5	Better a rebuke that is open than a love that is hidden.
Pr 27:6	The wounds of a friend mean well, but the kisses of an enemy are profane.
Pr 27:7	An {appetite}<note: Literally "soul"> that is sated spurns honey, but [to] an {appetite}<note: Literally "soul"> that is ravenous, all bitterness [is] sweet.
Pr 27:8	Like a bird that strays from its nest, so is a man who strays from his place.
Pr 27:9	Perfume and incense will gladden a heart, and the pleasantness of one's friend [is] {personal advice}.<note: Literally "because of advice of a person">
Pr 27:10	As for your friend and a friend of your father, do not forsake [them], and the house of your brother, do not enter on the day of your calamity. Better is a close neighbor than a distant brother.
Pr 27:11	Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad, and I will answer him who reproaches me [with] a word.
Pr 27:12	[When] the clever sees danger, he hides; the simple go on [and] suffer.
Pr 27:13	Take his garment, for he gives surety [to] a stranger, and to {an adulteress}<note: Literally "a foreign woman">--[so] take his pledge.
Pr 27:14	He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, a curse will be reckoned to him.
Pr 27:15	Dripping constantly on a day of heavy rain and a woman<note: Or "wife"> of contention are alike.
Pr 27:16	[In] restraining her, he restrains wind,<note: Or "breath, or "spirit"> and his right hand will grasp oil<note: Or "fat">.
Pr 27:17	[As] iron sharpens<note: Or "is united with"> iron, so {one man sharpens another}.<note: Literally "a man sharpens [the] faces of his friend">
Pr 27:18	He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who guards his master<note: Or "lord"> will be honored.
Pr 27:19	As the waters [reflect] {face to face},<note: Literally "the faces to the faces"> so the heart of a person [reflects] the person.
Pr 27:20	Sheol<note: A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld> and Abaddon<note: Poetic synonym for "Sheol." Only mentioned in the ot in relation to Sheol, the grave, or death.> will not be satisfied, and the eyes of a person will not be satisfied [either].
Pr 27:21	A crucible [is] for the silver, and a furnace for the gold, but a man [is tested by] the mouth of him who praises him.
Pr 27:22	If you crush a fool in the mortar with the pestle {along with}<note: Or "in the midst of"> the crushed grain, it will not drive folly from upon him.
Pr 27:23	You will surely know the {condition}<note: Literally "faces"> of your flock; your heart<note: Or "mind"> attends to the herds.
Pr 27:24	For riches [are] not forever, nor a crown for generation [after] generation.
Pr 27:25	When the grass is gone, then green growth will appear, and the herbs of the mountains will be gathered.
Pr 27:26	Lambs [will be] your clothing, and goats the price of the field.
Pr 27:27	And [there will be] enough goats' milk for your food, for [the] food of your household and [the] {nourishment}<note: Literally "life"> of your maidservants.


CHAPTER 28
Pr 28:1	The wicked flee, but no one pursues, but the righteous is bold like a lion.
Pr 28:2	By the rebellion of a land, her rulers increase, but by a person of intelligence who knows justice, it will last.
Pr 28:3	A man [who is] poor and oppresses the impoverished [is] a beating rain {that leaves}<note: Literally "and there is"> no food.
Pr 28:4	Those who forsake instruction will praise the wicked, but they who guard instruction will struggle against them.
Pr 28:5	Men of evil do not understand justice, but seekers of Yahweh understand completely.<note: Or "everything">
Pr 28:6	Better [to be] poor and walking in one's integrity than to be crooked of ways when one [is] rich.
Pr 28:7	He who keeps instruction [is] a child of understanding, but the companion of gluttons will shame his father.
Pr 28:8	He who augments his wealth with interest and with usury gathers it for him who is kind to the poor.
Pr 28:9	He who turns his ear from listening to instruction, even his prayer [is] an abomination.
Pr 28:10	He who misleads the upright onto the way of evil, into his pits he will fall. But as for the blameless, they will inherit good.
Pr 28:11	A man of wealth [is] wise in his own eyes, but the intelligent poor sees through him.
Pr 28:12	When the righteous triumphs, great [is] the glory, but with [the] rising of the wicked, a person will be hidden.
Pr 28:13	He who conceals his transgression will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes will obtain mercy.
Pr 28:14	Happy is the person who fears continuously, but he who is stubborn of heart,<note: Or "mind"> will fall into calamity.
Pr 28:15	[Like] a roaring lion and a charging bear [is] a wicked ruler over a poor people.
Pr 28:16	A ruler who lacks understanding is<note: Hebrew "and"> a cruel oppressor, [but] those who hate unjust gain will have long<note: Or "prolong"> days.
Pr 28:17	A person who is burdened with [the] blood of {another},<note: Literally "life"> until death he will flee; do not take hold of him.
Pr 28:18	He who walks in integrity will be safe, but he who takes crooked paths will fall in one.
Pr 28:19	He who tills his ground will have plenty bread, but he who follows fantasies will have plenty [of] poverty.
Pr 28:20	A man of faithfulness [has] abundant blessings, but he who hurries to become rich will not go unpunished.
Pr 28:21	{Showing partiality}<note: Literally "Recognizing faces"> [is] not good, and over a morsel of bread, a strong man will do wrong.
Pr 28:22	He who hurries for wealth is {a man with an evil eye},<note: Literally "a man of evil of eye"> but he does not know that poverty will come upon him.
Pr 28:23	He who rebukes a person will afterward find [more] favor than he who flatters [with the] tongue.
Pr 28:24	He who robs his father and his mother and says, "There is no crime," is partner to a man who corrupts.
Pr 28:25	The {greedy person}<note: Literally "wide soul"> will stir up strife, but he who trusts in Yahweh will be enriched.
Pr 28:26	He who trusts in his own heart<note: Or "mind," or "sense"> is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be saved.
Pr 28:27	[For] he who gives to the poor, there is no lacking, but [for] he<note: Hebrew "those"> who turns his eyes, [there are] many curses.
Pr 28:28	With [the] rising of the wicked, humankind will be hidden, and with their perishing, [the] righteous will multiply.


CHAPTER 29
Pr 29:1	A man who is reproved, being stubborn of neck-- suddenly he will be broken, and there will not be healing.
Pr 29:2	When the righteous are numerous, the people will rejoice, but when the wicked are ruling, people will groan.
Pr 29:3	A man who loves wisdom will make his parents glad, but the friend of prostitutes<note: Or "whores"> will squander his wealth.

Pr 29:11	A fool gives all his breath,<note: Or "spirit"> but [the] wise holds back in quiet.
Pr 29:12	A ruler listening to a word of falsehood, all his officials are wicked.
Pr 29:13	The poor and a man of oppression have [this] in common: Yahweh gives {light to the eyes of them both}.<note: Literally "light of the eyes of the two of them">
Pr 29:14	A king who judges with truthfulness [to] the poor, his throne will be established forever.
Pr 29:15	As for a rod and reproof, they<note: Hebrew "it"> will give wisdom, but a neglected child is disgraced [by] his mother.
Pr 29:16	With the increase of the wicked, transgression will increase, but the righteous will look on his downfall.
Pr 29:17	Discipline your children, and they will give you rest, and they will give delight to your soul.<note: Or "life," or "inner self">
Pr 29:18	When there is no prophecy, the people cast off restraint, but as for he who guards instruction, happiness [is] his.
Pr 29:19	By words, a servant is not disciplined, for he will understand, but there is no giving heed.
Pr 29:20	You see a man who is hasty in his words: [there is more] hope for a fool than him.
Pr 29:21	He who pampers his servant from childhood, {arrogance will be his end}.<note: Literally "and its/his end will be arrogance">
Pr 29:22	A man of anger will stir strife, and the owner of anger, much transgression.
Pr 29:23	The pride of a person will bring him humiliation, and the lowly of spirit will obtain honor.
Pr 29:24	Being a partner with a thief is hating one's life;<note: Or "soul," or "inner self"> a curse he will hear, but not disclose.
Pr 29:25	The fear of a person will lay a snare, but he who trusts in Yahweh will be secure.

CHAPTER 30
Pr 30:1	The words of Agur, son of Yakeh, the oracle. Thus says the man to Ithiel, to Ithiel, and Ucal:<note: Or "I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God, and worn out">
Pr 30:2	Certainly I [am more] stupid than a man, and the understanding of humankind [is] not for me.
Pr 30:3	And I have not learned wisdom, nor will I know knowledge of the Holy One.<note: Or "holy ones">
Pr 30:4	Who has ascended [to] heaven and come down? Who has gathered [the] wind in the hollow of his hand? Who has wrapped water in a<note: Hebrew "the"> garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What [is] his name and what is the name of his child? For [surely] you know.
Pr 30:5	Every word of God [is] flawless; he [is] a shield for him who takes refuge in him.
Pr 30:6	Do not add to his words lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.
Pr 30:7	Two things I ask from you; do not deny me before I die:
Pr 30:8	Keep falsehood and a {lying word}<note: Literally "word of a lie"> far from me; do not give me poverty or wealth; provide me [with] food [only for] my need.
Pr 30:9	Or else I will be satisfied and will deny [him] and say "Who [is] Yahweh?" Or<note: Or "Lest"> I will be poor and will steal and profane the name of my God.
Pr 30:10	Do not slander a servant to his master, or else he will curse you and you will be guilty.
Pr 30:11	[There is] a generation [that] will curse its father, and its mother it will not bless.
Pr 30:12	[There is] a generation [that is] pure in its own eyes, but from its filthiness it will not be cleansed.
Pr 30:13	[There is] a generation--how lofty [are] their eyes! And their eyelids they will lift.
Pr 30:14	[There is] a generation whose teeth [are] swords, and its jawbones, knives, [in order] to devour the poor from the earth<note: Or "land"> and the needy from humankind.
Pr 30:15	For the leech, [there are] two daughters; "Give, give!" [they cry]. As for three of these, they are not satisfied; as for four, they do not say enough.
Pr 30:16	Sheol<note: A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld> and barrenness of womb, the land is not satisfied [with] water, and fire does not say "enough!"
Pr 30:17	The eye [that] mocks a father and scorns the obedience of a mother-- the ravens of the valley will peck it out, and the offspring of vultures will eat it.
Pr 30:18	Three of these are [too] wonderful for me, and four, I do not understand them:
Pr 30:19	the way of the eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship in the heart of the sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.
Pr 30:20	This is the way of a woman committing adultery: she eats and wipes her mouth, and says "I have not done wrong."
Pr 30:21	Under three [things] the earth<note: Or "land"> trembles, and under four, it is not able to bear up:
Pr 30:22	under a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is satisfied [with] food;
Pr 30:23	under an unloved woman when she gets married, and a maid when she succeeds her mistress.
Pr 30:24	There [are] four small things on the earth, and they [are] {exceedingly wise}:<note: Literally "wise [ones] from wise [ones]">
Pr 30:25	The ants [are] a people [who are] not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;
Pr 30:26	the badgers [are] a people [who are] not mighty, yet they set their house on the rock;
Pr 30:27	there is no king for the locust, yet it marches in rank;
Pr 30:28	a lizard you [can] seize with hands, yet it is in palaces of kings.
Pr 30:29	There [are] three [things] that are magnificent of stride, and four that are magnificent [when] moving:
Pr 30:30	a mighty lion among the beasts,<note: Hebrew "beasts"> but he will not turn back from {any face};<note: Literally "faces of all">
Pr 30:31	a strutting rooster or he-goat, and a king [whose] army [is] with him.
Pr 30:32	If you have been foolish by exalting yourself, and if you have devised evil, [put your] hand to [your] mouth.
Pr 30:33	For pressing milk produces curd, and pressing the nose produces blood, so pressing {anger}<note: Literally "nostrils"> produces strife.


CHAPTER 31
Pr 31:1	The words of Lemuel, [the] king--an oracle that his mother taught him:
Pr 31:2	What, my son? And what, my son in my womb? And what, son of my vows?
Pr 31:3	Do not give your strength to the women, and your ways to destroy kings.
Pr 31:4	[It is] not for the kings, O Lemuel; drinking wine [is] not for the kings, nor [is] strong drink for rulers.
Pr 31:5	Or else he will drink and forget what has been decreed, and he will pervert the rights<note: Hebrew "right"> of all the {afflicted}.<note: Literally "sons of affliction">
Pr 31:6	Give strong drink to him who is perishing, and wine to those {in bitter distress}.<note: Literally "to bitterness of soul">
Pr 31:7	He will drink and forget his poverty, and his misery he will not remember [any] more.
Pr 31:8	Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights<note: Hebrew "right"> of all the {needy}.<note: Literally "the sons of the needy">
Pr 31:9	Open your mouth, judge righteousness, and defend [the] poor and needy.

Pr 31:10	A woman<note: Or "wife"> of excellence,<note: Or "strength," or "valor," or "ability," or "efficiency"> who will find? For her worth [is] far more than precious jewels.
Pr 31:11	The heart of her husband<note: Or "lord"> trusts in her, and gain he will not lack.
Pr 31:12	She does him good, but not harm all the days of her life.
Pr 31:13	She seeks wool and flax, and she works with the diligence of {her hands}.<note: Literally "her palms">
Pr 31:14	She is like the ships of a merchant; from far off she brings her food;<note: Or "bread">
Pr 31:15	And she arises while [it is] still night, and gives food to her household, and tasks to her servant girls.
Pr 31:16	She considers a field and buys it, from the fruit of {her hand}<note: Literally "her palm"> she plants a vineyard.
Pr 31:17	She girds her waist in strength, and makes her arms strong.
Pr 31:18	She perceives that her merchandise [is] good; her lamp does not go out in the night.
Pr 31:19	Her hands she puts onto the distaff,<note: A stick or spindle onto which wool or flax is wound in preparation for spinning> and her palms hold a spindle.
Pr 31:20	Her palm she opens to the poor, and her hand she reaches [out] to the needy.
Pr 31:21	She does not fear for her house [when] it snows, for {her entire household}<note: Literally "all her house, household"> is clothed [in] crimson.
Pr 31:22	She makes for herself coverings; her clothing [is] fine linen and purple.
Pr 31:23	Her husband<note: Or "lord"> is known at the gates, in his seat among the elders of the land.
Pr 31:24	Linen garments she makes and sells, and she supplies sashes for the merchants.
Pr 31:25	Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs {at the future}.<note: Literally "to the day/time coming after">
Pr 31:26	She opens her mouth with wisdom, and instruction of kindness [is] upon her tongue.
