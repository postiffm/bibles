Rev 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him to show His servants the things which must come to pass quickly. And He made it known by sending it through His angel to His servant John,
Rev 1:2 who testified to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things as He saw, both the things that are and those that must happen after these.
Rev 1:3 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who keep the things having been written in it; for the time is near.
Rev 1:4 John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,
Rev 1:5 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and who washed us from our sins in His own blood,
Rev 1:6 and He made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Rev 1:7 Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen!
Rev 1:8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "He who is and He who was and He who is to come, The Almighty."
Rev 1:9 I, John, your brother and partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Christ Jesus, came to be on the island that is called Patmos on account of the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
Rev 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard a loud voice like a trumpet behind me,
Rev 1:11 saying, "That which you see, write in a book and send to the seven churches: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
Rev 1:12 And there I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,
Rev 1:13 and in the midst of the seven lampstands stood One like the Son of Man, having been clothed in a robe reaching to His feet and having been girded across His chest with a golden belt.
Rev 1:14 And His head and His hair were white, and like white wool, like snow, and His eyes were like a flame of fire;
Rev 1:15 And His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;
Rev 1:16 He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was as the sun shining in its strength.
Rev 1:17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as if dead. But He put His right hand on me, saying, "Do not fear; I am the First and the Last.
Rev 1:18 I am He who lives, and became dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Death and of Hades.
Rev 1:19 Write therefore the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.
Rev 1:20 The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.
Rev 2:1 "To the messenger of the church of Ephesus write, 'These things says He that holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:
Rev 2:2 "I know your works, and your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you tested those who say that they are apostles and they are not, and you found them to be false;
Rev 2:3 and you have endurance and you have born patiently on account of My name, and you did not become weary.
Rev 2:4 Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.
Rev 2:5 Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you quickly and I will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.
Rev 2:6 But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Rev 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of My God." '
Rev 2:8 "And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write, 'These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and came to life:
Rev 2:9 "I know your works, and your tribulation, and your poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
Rev 2:10 Fear none of those things which you are about to suffer. Behold indeed, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
Rev 2:11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall in no way be harmed by the second death." '
Rev 2:12 "And to the messenger of the church in Pergamos write, 'These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:
Rev 2:13 "I know your works, and where you live, where Satan's throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith in the days in which Antipas was My faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
Rev 2:14 But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, both to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.
Rev 2:15 Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which likewise I hate.
Rev 2:16 Repent therefore! Or else I will come to you quickly, and make war against them with the sword of My mouth.
Rev 2:17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to him some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except he who receives it." '
Rev 2:18 "And to the messenger of the church in Thyatira write, 'These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:
Rev 2:19 "I know your works, and love, and faith and service, and your endurance; and your last works are greater than the first.
Rev 2:20 But I have this against you, that you tolerate your wife Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.
Rev 2:21 And I gave her time so that she might repent, and she does not wish to repent of her sexual immorality.
Rev 2:22 Behold, I am casting her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, if they do not repent of her works.
Rev 2:23 I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.
Rev 2:24 But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.
Rev 2:25 Only hold fast what you have till I come.
Rev 2:26 And he who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations—
Rev 2:27 'AND HE SHALL RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON; THEY SHALL BE SMASHED TO PIECES LIKE CLAY VESSELS'—as I also have received from My Father;
Rev 2:28 and I will give him the morning star.
Rev 2:29 "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." '
Rev 3:1 "And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write, 'These things says He that has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: "I know your works, that you have a name, that you live, but you are dead.
Rev 3:2 Be watchful, and strengthen that which remains, which you were about to cast out, for I have not found your works perfect before My God.
Rev 3:3 Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you like a thief, and by no means shall you know what hour I will come upon you.
Rev 3:4 You have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white, because they are worthy.
Rev 3:5 He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and by no means shall I erase his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
Rev 3:6 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." '
Rev 3:7 "And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write, 'These things says the Holy One, the True One, "HE WHO HAS THE KEY OF DAVID, HE THAT OPENS AND NO MAN SHUTS, EXCEPT HE THAT OPENS, AND NO MAN SHALL OPEN."
Rev 3:8 "I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it; because you have a little strength and have kept My word, and you have not denied My name.
Rev 3:9 Behold, I will give those of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews and are not, but they are lying—behold, I will make them to come and bow down at your feet, and they shall know that I have loved you.
Rev 3:10 Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those that dwell upon the earth.
Rev 3:11 I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no man may take your crown.
Rev 3:12 He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and by no means shall he go out any longer. And I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven from My God. And My new name.
Rev 3:13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." '
Rev 3:14 "And to the messenger of the church in Laodicea write, 'These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
Rev 3:15 "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were cold or hot.
Rev 3:16 Therefore, since you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of My mouth.
Rev 3:17 Because you say, 'I am wealthy, and have become rich, and have need of nothing'—and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked,
Rev 3:18 I counsel you to buy from Me gold having been tried by fire, so that you may become rich; and white robes, so that you may be clothed, and the shame of your nakedness may not appear; and eye salve, so that you may anoint your eyes, in order that you may see.
Rev 3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. Be zealous therefore, and repent.
Rev 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and I am knocking. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and I will dine with him, and he with Me.
Rev 3:21 He that overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.
Rev 3:22 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." ' "
Rev 4:1 After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must take place after this."
Rev 4:2 Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was set in heaven (and One sitting on the throne)
Rev 4:3 similar in appearance to a jasper and sardius stone, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.
Rev 4:4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw the twenty-four elders sitting, having been clothed in white robes; and on their heads were crowns of gold.
Rev 4:5 And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders. And seven torches of fire were burning before His throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
Rev 4:6 And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living beings full of eyes in front and in back.
Rev 4:7 The first living being was like a lion, the second living being was like a calf, the third living being had a face of a man, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle.
Rev 4:8 And the four living beings, each one having six wings apiece, were full of eyes around and within. And they never rest day or night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, He who was, and who is, and who is to come!"
Rev 4:9 Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him that sits on the throne, to Him that lives forever and ever,
Rev 4:10 the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and they worship Him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
Rev 4:11 "You are worthy, our Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive the glory and the honor and the power; because You created all things, and by Your will they existed and they were created."
Rev 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a scroll, having been written inside and outside, and having been sealed with seven seals.
Rev 5:2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?"
Rev 5:3 And no one in heaven above or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, nor to look at it.
Rev 5:4 And I began to weep much, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll, nor to look at it.
Rev 5:5 But one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome, to open the scroll and its seven seals."
Rev 5:6 And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living beings, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
Rev 5:7 Then He came and took out of the right hand of Him that sat on the throne.
Rev 5:8 And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls being filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
Rev 5:9 And they sang a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; because You were slain, and You redeemed us to God by Your blood, out of every tribe and language and people and nation;
Rev 5:10 and have made them kings and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."
Rev 5:11 Then I looked, and I heard as it were the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living beings, and the elders. And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and a thousand thousands,
Rev 5:12 saying with a loud voice: "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive the power and the wealth and wisdom and strength, and honor and glory and blessing!"
Rev 5:13 And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: "Blessing and honor and glory and power to Him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever. Amen!"
Rev 5:14 And the four living beings said “Amen!” And the elders fell down and worshiped.
Rev 6:1 And I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings saying, like a voice of thunder, "Come."
Rev 6:2 And behold, a white horse. And he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering, and to conquer.
Rev 6:3 And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living being saying, "Come!"
Rev 6:4 Another horse went out, fiery red, and it was granted to him that sat on it to take peace from the earth, so that they might kill each other; and there was given to him a great sword.
Rev 6:5 And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, "Come." And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.
Rev 6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living beings, saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine."
Rev 6:7 And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being saying, "Come."
Rev 6:8 And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it was named Death, and Hades was following him. And authority was given to him over a fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
Rev 6:9 And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.
Rev 6:10 And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
Rev 6:11 And a long white robe was given to them, and it was said to them that they should rest yet a while, until also their fellow servants and their brothers, who were about to be killed as also they were, should complete their course.
Rev 6:12 And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, that there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became like blood.
Rev 6:13 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, like a fig tree casting its untimely figs, being shaken by a mighty wind.
Rev 6:14 Then the sky was split like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were removed out of their places.
Rev 6:15 And the kings of the earth, and the magnates and the high-ranking military men, and the rich and the mighty, and every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the crags of the mountains.
Rev 6:16 And they said to the mountains and crags, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb!
Rev 6:17 For the great day of His wrath has come, and who shall be able to stand?"
Rev 7:1 And after this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that a wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
Rev 7:2 Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the earth and the sea,
Rev 7:3 saying, "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."
Rev 7:4 And I heard the number of those having been sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:
Rev 7:5 of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand having been sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;
Rev 7:6 of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;
Rev 7:7 of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;
Rev 7:8 of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand, having been sealed.
Rev 7:9 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number, out of every nation, and from tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, having been clothed in long white robes, with palm branches in their hands.
Rev 7:10 And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation belongs to our God, to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
Rev 7:11 And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living beings, and they fell down on their faces before His throne and they worshiped God,
Rev 7:12 saying: "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom, and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen."
Rev 7:13 Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, "Who are these arrayed in long white robes, and where did they come from?"
Rev 7:14 And I said to him, "My lord, you know." So he said to me, "These are those who come out of the Great Tribulation, and have washed their robes and they made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Rev 7:15 Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His temple. And He that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.
Rev 7:16 They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; nor shall the sun by any means strike them, nor any scorching heat;
Rev 7:17 because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and He leads them to the springs of the waters of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
Rev 8:1 And when He opened the seventh seal, silence occurred in heaven for about half an hour.
Rev 8:2 And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
Rev 8:3 Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. And much incense was given to him, so that he could offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne.
Rev 8:4 And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God.
Rev 8:5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and he cast it to the earth. And there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.
Rev 8:6 So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the trumpets.
Rev 8:7 And the first one sounded his trumpet, and there was hail and fire, having been mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees was burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
Rev 8:8 Then the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great burning mountain was cast into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.
Rev 8:9 And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
Rev 8:10 Then the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of water.
Rev 8:11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
Rev 8:12 Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them was darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.
Rev 8:13 And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe for those who dwell on the earth, from the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!"
Rev 9:1 Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star having fallen out of heaven, to the earth. And the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit was given to him.
Rev 9:2 And he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a burning furnace. And the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the shaft.
Rev 9:3 Then out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth. And power was given to them, as scorpions of the earth have power.
Rev 9:4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any plant, nor any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
Rev 9:5 And they were not permitted to kill them, but that they should torment them for five months. And their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.
Rev 9:6 And in those days men shall seek death, and shall by no means find it; they shall be longing to die, yet death shall elude them.
Rev 9:7 And the appearances of the locusts was similar to horses having been prepared for battle, and on their heads were like crowns of gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
Rev 9:8 They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.
Rev 9:9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots with many horses rushing into battle.
Rev 9:10 And they had tails like scorpions, and stings. And in their tails they have power to harm men five months,
Rev 9:11 having as a king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
Rev 9:12 One woe is past. Behold, yet two woes are coming after these things.
Rev 9:13 Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
Rev 9:14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels having been bound at the great river Euphrates."
Rev 9:15 So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for that very hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill a third of mankind.
Rev 9:16 Now the number of the troops of the horsemen was a hundred million; I heard the number of them.
Rev 9:17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who rode on them, having breastplates of fire, hyacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire, and smoke, and brimstone.
Rev 9:18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed—from the fire and the smoke and the brimstone proceeding out of their mouths.
Rev 9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.
Rev 9:20 But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent from the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and of wood, which neither are able to see nor to hear nor to walk.
Rev 9:21 And they did not repent of their murders nor of their drugs nor of their sexual immorality nor of their thefts.
Rev 10:1 And I saw a mighty angel coming down from heaven, having been clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire,
Rev 10:2 and having in his hand a scroll having been opened. And he put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land,
Rev 10:3 and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.
Rev 10:4 Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken, and do not write them."
Rev 10:5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven
Rev 10:6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it, the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there should be no more delay;
Rev 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.
Rev 10:8 Then the voice which I heard from heaven was speaking with me again and saying, "Go, take the little scroll which was open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land."
Rev 10:9 And I went to the angel, saying to him to give to me the little scroll. And he said to me, "Take it and eat it; and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth."
Rev 10:10 Then I took the scroll out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. And when I ate it, my stomach was made bitter.
Rev 10:11 And he said to me, "You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
Rev 11:1 Then a reed was given to me like a rod, saying, "Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship in it.
Rev 11:2 But leave out the outer court of the temple, and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. And they shall trample the holy city for forty-two months.
Rev 11:3 And I will give power to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, having been clothed in sackcloth."
Rev 11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
Rev 11:5 And if anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.
Rev 11:6 These men have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they wish.
Rev 11:7 And when they finish their testimony, the beast who ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war with them, and will overcome them, and will kill them.
Rev 11:8 And their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
Rev 11:9 Then some of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations shall see their dead bodies for three-and-a-half days, and they will not allow their bodies to be put into a tomb.
Rev 11:10 And those who dwell on the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
Rev 11:11 Now after the three-and-a-half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who were watching them.
Rev 11:12 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
Rev 11:13 In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand men were killed. And the rest became fearful and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Rev 11:14 The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
Rev 11:15 Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"
Rev 11:16 And the twenty-four elders, those before the throne of God who sit on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
Rev 11:17 saying: "We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, The One who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.
Rev 11:18 The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and to those that fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
Rev 11:19 Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord appeared in His temple. And there were lightnings and voices and thunders, and great hail.
Rev 12:1 And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman having been clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
Rev 12:2 And being pregnant, she was crying out, being in labor and being in great pain to give birth.
Rev 12:3 And another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great, fiery dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.
Rev 12:4 And his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that whenever she might give birth, he might devour her Child.
Rev 12:5 And she gave birth to a Son, a male who would shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her Child was caught up to God and to His throne.
Rev 12:6 Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place having been prepared by God, so that they may nourish her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
Rev 12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels, waging war with the dragon; and the dragon made war, and his angels,
Rev 12:8 and he was not strong enough, nor was a place found for him any longer in heaven.
Rev 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
Rev 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because the accuser of our brothers, the one who accused them before our God day and night, has been thrown out of heaven.
Rev 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.
Rev 12:12 Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and to the sea! Because the devil has been thrown down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."
Rev 12:13 Now when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child.
Rev 12:14 And the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly into the desert to her place, so that she might be nourished there for a time and times and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
Rev 12:15 And the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a river after the woman, so that he might cause her to be carried off by the river.
Rev 12:16 But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon had cast out of his mouth.
Rev 12:17 And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went off to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.
Rev 13:1 Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads blasphemous names.
Rev 13:2 And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.
Rev 13:3 And one of his heads was as if it had been wounded to death, and his wound of death was healed. And the whole world marveled after the beast.
Rev 13:4 And they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"
Rev 13:5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy, and authority was given to him to make war for forty-two months.
Rev 13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His dwelling, and those who dwell in heaven.
Rev 13:7 And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given to him over every tribe, people, language, and nation.
Rev 13:8 And all those who dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose name is not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
Rev 13:9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
Rev 13:10 If anyone has captivity, he goes away; if anyone is with the sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
Rev 13:11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.
Rev 13:12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it, to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
Rev 13:13 And he works great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth before men.
Rev 13:14 And he deceives my own people who dwell on the earth by the signs which were given to him to do before the beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound of the sword and came to life.
Rev 13:15 And it was given to him to give life to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
Rev 13:16 And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, that they should receive marks on their right hand, or on their foreheads,
Rev 13:17 and that no one may be able to buy or sell except he that has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Rev 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man—his number is 666.
Rev 14:1 And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father having been written on their foreheads.
Rev 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And the voice which I heard was as of harpists playing on their harps.
Rev 14:3 And they sang a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.
Rev 14:4 These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
Rev 14:5 And no guile was found in their mouth, for they are blameless.
Rev 14:6 Then I saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people,
Rev 14:7 saying with a loud voice, "Fear the Lord and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and you shall worship Him who made heaven and earth, and the sea and fountains of waters."
Rev 14:8 And another, a second angel followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. From the wine of the wrath of her fornication, she has made all the nations to drink.”
Rev 14:9 Then another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
Rev 14:10 then he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out undiluted in the cup of His wrath. And they shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.
Rev 14:11 And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and his image, and anyone who receives the mark of his name."
Rev 14:12 Here is the endurance of the saints; those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
Rev 14:13 And I heard a voice out of heaven saying to me, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. “Yes,” says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them."
Rev 14:14 And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.
Rev 14:15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the hour has come to reap, because the harvest of the earth has withered."
Rev 14:16 So He that sat on the cloud swung His sickle onto the earth, and the earth was harvested.
Rev 14:17 Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.
Rev 14:18 And another angel came out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a loud cry to the one having the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the grape clusters of the vine of the earth, because the grapes are ripe."
Rev 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
Rev 14:20 And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles, about one thousand six hundred stadia.
Rev 15:1 Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, because in them the wrath of God is finished.
Rev 15:2 And I saw something like a glassy sea having been mixed with fire, and those who prevailed over the beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having the harps of God.
Rev 15:3 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: "Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!
Rev 15:4 Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, because Your righteous judgments have been manifested."
Rev 15:5 After these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
Rev 15:6 And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, who were dressed in pure bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden belts.
Rev 15:7 Then one of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
Rev 15:8 And the temple was filled by the smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
Rev 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth."
Rev 16:2 So the first went off and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and a bad and malignant ulcer came upon the men having the mark of the beast, and those who worshiped his image.
Rev 16:3 Then the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died.
Rev 16:4 Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and into the springs of water, and it became blood.
Rev 16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying: "You are righteous, the One who is, and who was, holy, because You have judged these things;
Rev 16:6 for they shed the blood of saints and prophets, and You gave them blood to drink; for they are worthy."
Rev 16:7 And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments."
Rev 16:8 Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to him to burn men with fire.
Rev 16:9 And men were burned with severe burns, and men blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues; and they did not repent to give Him glory.
Rev 16:10 Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues from the pain.
Rev 16:11 They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works.
Rev 16:12 Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.
Rev 16:13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
Rev 16:14 For they are demonic spirits performing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
Rev 16:15 Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and guards his garments, lest he should walk naked and they should see his shame."
Rev 16:16 And he gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.
Rev 16:17 Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
Rev 16:18 And there were lightnings and thunders, and noises; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since men were on the earth, so great an earthquake, so great!
Rev 16:19 Now the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the rage of His wrath.
Rev 16:20 Then every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
Rev 16:21 And great hail from heaven fell upon men, each hailstone weighing a talent. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, since this plague was exceedingly severe.
Rev 17:1 Then one of the seven angels having the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
Rev 17:2 with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and those dwelling on the earth became drunk from the wine of her fornication."
Rev 17:3 And he led me away in the Spirit, into a deserted place. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
Rev 17:4 And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup being filled with abominations and the filthiness of the fornication of the earth.
Rev 17:5 And on her forehead a name was written, a mystery: BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
Rev 17:6 I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.
Rev 17:7 But the angel said to me, "Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast carrying her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
Rev 17:8 The beast which you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to perdition. And those who dwell on the earth shall marvel, whose name is not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and shall be present.
Rev 17:9 Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.
Rev 17:10 And there are seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And whenever he comes, he must abide for a short time.
Rev 17:11 And the beast which was, and is not, is also an eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to perdition.
Rev 17:12 And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet have received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.
Rev 17:13 These have one purpose, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.
Rev 17:14 These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, and elect, and faithful."
Rev 17:15 Then he said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
Rev 17:16 And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her up with fire.
Rev 17:17 For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
Rev 17:18 And the woman whom you saw is that great city which has royal rule over the kings of the earth."
Rev 18:1 After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lit up from his splendor.
Rev 18:2 And he cried out with a strong voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and she has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every unclean spirit, and a cage for every unclean and detestable bird!
Rev 18:3 For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the wealth of her luxury."
Rev 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, lest you participate in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.
Rev 18:5 Because her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.
Rev 18:6 Give back to her as also she gave back to you, and pay back double as also she did, and according to her works. In her cup which she mixed, mix for her a double portion.
Rev 18:7 In as many things as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same measure give to her torment and sorrow; because she says in her heart, 'I sit as queen, and am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow.'
Rev 18:8 "On account of this her plagues will come in one day—death, sorrow, and famine. And she shall be burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who has judged her.
Rev 18:9 "The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her shall weep and mourn over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,
Rev 18:10 standing from afar on account of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! Because in one hour your judgment has come.'
Rev 18:11 "And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:
Rev 18:12 merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;
Rev 18:13 and cinnamon and incense, perfume and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.
Rev 18:14 The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you, and all the sumptuous things and the gaudy things have perished from you, and you shall by no means find them no more.
Rev 18:15 The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, shall stand at afar on account of the fear of her torment, both weeping and sorrowing,
Rev 18:16 and saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city, she who was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and having been gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls!
Rev 18:17 Because in one hour such great wealth was laid waste.' And every captain, and all those sailing along the coast, and sailors, and as many as work on the sea, stood from afar
Rev 18:18 and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, 'Who is like this great city?'
Rev 18:19 "And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and sorrowing, and saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city, by which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! Because in one hour she was laid waste.'
Rev 18:20 "Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her!"
Rev 18:21 Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence Babylon the great city shall be cast down, and shall by no means be found anymore.
Rev 18:22 The sound of harpists, and musicians, and of flutists, and of trumpeters shall by no means be heard in you anymore. And no craftsman of any craft shall by no means be found in you anymore, and the sound of a mill shall by no means be heard in you anymore.
Rev 18:23 And the light of a lamp shall by no means shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and of a bride shall by no means be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the magnates of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived.
Rev 18:24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all those who had been slain on the earth."
Rev 19:1 After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God!
Rev 19:2 For true and righteous are His judgments, for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication; and He has avenged the blood of His servants shed by her hand."
Rev 19:3 And a second one said, "Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever!"
Rev 19:4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen! Hallelujah!"
Rev 19:5 Then a voice came from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all His servants and those who fear Him, both small and great!"
Rev 19:6 And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, and like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord God Almighty has begun to reign!
Rev 19:7 Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give Him glory, for the wedding of the Lamb has come, and His wife has prepared herself."
Rev 19:8 And to her it was granted that she should be dressed in fine linen, bright and pure, for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
Rev 19:9 Then he said to me, "Write: 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb!' "And he said to me, "These are the true words of God."
Rev 19:10 And I fell before his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "See that you do not! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
Rev 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.
Rev 19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns, having names written, and a name written that no one knows except Himself.
Rev 19:13 And He is clothed in a robe having been dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.
Rev 19:14 And the armies in heaven were following Him on white horses, having been dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
Rev 19:15 And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, so that with it He might strike the nations. And He will shepherd them with an iron rod. And He treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath of Almighty God.
Rev 19:16 And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name having been written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
Rev 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come and gather together for the great supper of God,
Rev 19:18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who ride on them, and the flesh of all people, free and bond, both small and great."
Rev 19:19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, having been gathered together to make war against Him who rode on the horse and against His army.
Rev 19:20 Then the beast was apprehended, and with him the false prophet who had performed the signs before him, by which he had deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.
Rev 19:21 And the rest were slain with the sword which proceeds from the mouth of Him who rode on the horse. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.
Rev 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
Rev 20:2 And he seized the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole world, and he bound him for a thousand years;
Rev 20:3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and locked and sealed it over him, so that he should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a short time.
Rev 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and they did not receive the mark on their forehead or on their hand. And they came to life and reigned with Christ for the thousand years.
Rev 20:5 But the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no authority, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him for a thousand years.
Rev 20:7 Now after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison,
Rev 20:8 and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, whose number is like the sand of the sea.
Rev 20:9 They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.
Rev 20:10 And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone where also the beast and the false prophet are. And they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.
Rev 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and He who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled. And no place was found for them.
Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged by the things having been written in the books, according to their works.
Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to their works.
Rev 20:14 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
Rev 20:15 And if anyone was not found having been written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
Rev 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And there was no more sea.
Rev 21:2 Then I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, having been prepared like a bride having been adorned for her husband.
Rev 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them.
Rev 21:4 And He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying out; neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things have passed away."
Rev 21:5 Then He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He said to me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."
Rev 21:6 And He said to me, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give from the spring of the water of life freely to him that is thirsty.
Rev 21:7 He that overcomes I shall give to him these things, and I shall be God to him, and he shall be to Me a son.
Rev 21:8 But the cowardly and unbelieving and sinners and abominable and murderers and sexually immoral and drug users and idolaters and all who are false shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
Rev 21:9 Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls being full with the seven last plagues and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the wife, the bride of the Lamb."
Rev 21:10 And he carried me away in the Spirit onto a great and high mountain, and he showed to me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
Rev 21:11 having the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal,
Rev 21:12 having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:
Rev 21:13 three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
Rev 21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Rev 21:15 And he who spoke with me had a measure, a golden reed, so that he might measure the city, and its gates.
Rev 21:16 The city is laid out like a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.
Rev 21:17 And its wall is one hundred and forty-four cubits, by the measure of a man, which is, of an angel.
Rev 21:18 And the construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
Rev 21:19 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
