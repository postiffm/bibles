If we ignore these known duplicates, \+bd M\+bd*\+sup d\+sup* comes out with 14 MSS, \+bd M\+bd*\+sup e\+sup* with 28, M\+sup a\+sup*-M\+sup b\+sup* with 16, and \+bd M\+bd*\+sup i\+sup* with 10.

\im \bd Comment:\bd* As illustrated by this stemma, I posit three main lines of transmission. It follows that if \bd h\bd* agrees with \bd f\bd*\sup 35\sup* against \bd d,e\bd* (and \bd a,b,f,g,i\bd*) then in 150 we could have two lines against one. Similarly, if \bd g\bd* or \bd b\bd* agrees with \bd f\bd*\sup 35\sup* against the rest, then in 150 we could have two lines against one. In such an event there would have to be comparison going on—in the first case either \bd h\bd* assimilated to \bd f\bd*\sup 35\sup* (if the rest have the true reading) or \bd d,e\bd* assimilated to \bd a,b,f,g,i\bd* (or \bd f\bd*\sup 35\sup* did the assimilating).
