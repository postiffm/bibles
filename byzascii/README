This Greek Bible text has the following identification and copyright
information.

The Greek New Testament according to the Byzantine Text form. 2000 Revision.
Edited by Maurice A. Robinson and William G. Pierpont

This text was originally released into the public domain as Freeware,
1985 - 2000. The updated and corrected version remains basically
identical to that original text, and may be utilized by anyone for any
purpose without further restriction or permission.

All of the following Greek New Testament files have been keyed in,
prepared, and proofed by Maurice A. Robinson, Ph. D., during the
period 1984-2000, and have been released into the public
domain. Anyone is free to use these files for any purpose, although
source attribution to the preparer is requested for the purpose of
fixing responsibility for the text as it appears and for any errors
which may still exist. All Greek texts are unaccented and unaspirated,
and also lack punctuation and capitalization.

The Greek is keyed to the Online Bible format, which differs from
nearly all Greek fonts in the following respects: Theta = y; Psi = Q,
final Sigma = v. These can easily be changed as necessary, and the
file SYMCNVT.EXE is included for speedy conversion to the Windows
Symbol font

	For this file, the final sigma is a lowercase v, but in most
	ascii-encoded fonts, that is an acute accent. The uppercase V
	is used to get the final sigma.
