1Ch 5:20 They received divine help in fighting them, and the Hagrites and all their allies were handed over to them. They cried out to God during the battle; he responded to their prayers because they trusted in him. 
1Ch 5:21 They seized the Hagrites’ animals, including 50,000 camels,  250,000 sheep,  and 2,000 donkeys. They also took captive 100,000 people.

1Ch 5:25 But they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors and worshiped instead the gods of the native peoples whom God had destroyed before them. 
1Ch 5:26 So the God of Israel stirred up King Pul of Assyria (that is, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria), and he carried away the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh and took them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan, where they remain to this very day.

1Ch 10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel. The Israelites fled before the Philistines and many of them fell dead on Mount Gilboa.  
1Ch 10:2 The Philistines stayed right on the heels of Saul and his sons. They struck down Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua. 
1Ch 10:3 The battle was thick around Saul; the archers spotted him and wounded him.  
1Ch 10:4 Saul told his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and stab me with it. Otherwise these uncircumcised people will come and torture me.” But his armor bearer refused to do it, because he was very afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
1Ch 10:5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died.  
1Ch 10:6 So Saul and his three sons died; his whole household died together.  
1Ch 10:7 When all the Israelites who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. The Philistines came and occupied them. 
1Ch 10:8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip loot from the corpses, they discovered Saul and his sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.  
1Ch 10:9 They stripped his corpse, and then carried off his head and his armor. They sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines proclaiming the news to their idols and their people.  
1Ch 10:10 They placed his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.  
1Ch 10:11 When all the residents of Jabesh Gilead heard about everything the Philistines had done to Saul,  
1Ch 10:12 all the warriors went and recovered the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their remains under the oak tree in Jabesh and fasted for seven days.  
1Ch 10:13 So Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord and did not obey the Lord’s instructions; he even tried to conjure up underworld spirits. 
1Ch 10:14 He did not seek the Lord’s guidance, so the Lord killed him and transferred the kingdom to David son of Jesse.  
1Ch 11:1 All Israel joined David at Hebron and said, “Look, we are your very flesh and blood! 
1Ch 11:2 In the past, even when Saul was king, you were Israel’s commanding general. The Lord your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel; you will rule over my people Israel.’”  
1Ch 11:3 When all the leaders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord. They anointed David king over Israel, in keeping with the Lord’s message that came through Samuel.  
1Ch 11:4 David and the whole Israelite army advanced to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). (The Jebusites, the land’s original inhabitants, lived there.)  
1Ch 11:5 The residents of Jebus said to David, “You cannot invade this place!” But David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).  
1Ch 11:6  David said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first will become commanding general!” So Joab son of Zeruiah attacked first and became commander.  
1Ch 11:7 David lived in the fortress; for this reason it is called the City of David.  
1Ch 11:8 He built up the city around it, from the terrace to the surrounding walls; Joab restored the rest of the city.  
1Ch 11:9 David’s power steadily grew, for the Lord of Heaven’s Armies was with him. 
1Ch 11:10 These were the leaders of David’s warriors who, together with all Israel, stood courageously with him in his kingdom by installing him as king, in keeping with the Lord’s message concerning Israel.  
1Ch 11:11 This is the list of David’s warriors: Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was head of the officers. He killed three hundred men with his spear in a single battle. 
1Ch 11:12 Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was one of the three elite warriors.  
1Ch 11:13 He was with David in Pas Dammim when the Philistines assembled there for battle. In an area of the field that was full of barley, the army retreated before the Philistines,  
1Ch 11:14 but then they made a stand in the middle of that area. They defended it and defeated the Philistines; the Lord gave them a great victory.  
1Ch 11:15 Three of the thirty leaders went down to David at the rocky cliff at the cave of Adullam, while a Philistine force was camped in the Valley of Rephaim.  
1Ch 11:16 David was in the stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.  
1Ch 11:17 David was thirsty and said, “How I wish someone would give me some water to drink from the cistern in Bethlehem near the city gate!”  
1Ch 11:18 So the three elite warriors broke through the Philistine forces and drew some water from the cistern in Bethlehem near the city gate. They carried it back to David, but David refused to drink it. He poured it out as a drink offering to the Lord  
1Ch 11:19 and said, “God forbid that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it to him, he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three elite warriors.  
1Ch 11:20 Abishai the brother of Joab was head of the three elite warriors. He killed three hundred men with his spear and gained fame along with the three elite warriors. 
1Ch 11:21 From the three he was given double honor and he became their officer, even though he was not one of them. 
1Ch 11:22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave warrior from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab; he also went down and killed a lion inside a cistern on a snowy day.  
1Ch 11:23 He even killed an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand as big as the crossbeam of a weaver’s loom; Benaiah attacked him with a club. He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.  
1Ch 11:24 Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who gained fame along with the three elite warriors.  
1Ch 11:25 He received honor from the thirty warriors, though he was not one of the three elite warriors. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.  
1Ch 11:26 The mighty warriors were:Asahel the brother of Joab,Elhanan son of Dodo, from Bethlehem,  
1Ch 11:27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,  
1Ch 11:28 Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,Abiezer the Anathothite,

1Ch 11:36 Hepher the Mekerathite,Ahijah the Pelonite,

1Ch 11:39 Zelek the Ammonite,Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,  
1Ch 11:40 Ira the Ithrite,Gareb the Ithrite,  
1Ch 11:41 Uriah the Hittite,Zabad son of Achli,  
1Ch 11:42 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, leader of the Reubenites and the thirty warriors with him, 
1Ch 11:43 Hanan son of Maacah,Joshaphat the Mithnite,  
1Ch 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite,Shama and Jeiel, the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,  
1Ch 11:45 Jediael son of Shimri,and Joha his brother, the Tizite,  
1Ch 11:46 Eliel the Mahavite,and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam,and Ithmah the Moabite,  
1Ch 11:47 Eliel,and Obed,and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.  
1Ch 12:1 These were the men who joined David in Ziklag, when he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish. (They were among the warriors who assisted him in battle.  
1Ch 12:2 They were armed with bows and could shoot arrows or sling stones right or left-handed. They were fellow tribesmen of Saul from Benjamin. ) These were: 
1Ch 12:3 Ahiezer,  the leader, and Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Berachah,Jehu the Anathothite,  
1Ch 12:4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, one of the thirty warriors and their leader,(12:5) Jeremiah,Jahaziel,Johanan,Jozabad the Gederathite,  
1Ch 12:5  (12:6) Eluzai,Jerimoth,Bealiah,Shemariah,Shephatiah the Haruphite,  
1Ch 12:6 Elkanah,  Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites,  
1Ch 12:7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.  
1Ch 12:8 Some of the Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were warriors who were trained for battle; they carried shields and spears. They were as fierce as lions and could run as quickly as gazelles across the hills.  
1Ch 12:9 Ezer was the leader, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,  
1Ch 12:10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,  
1Ch 12:11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,  
1Ch 12:12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,  
1Ch 12:13 Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh.  
1Ch 12:14 These Gadites were military leaders; the least led a hundred men, the greatest a thousand.  
1Ch 12:15 They crossed the Jordan River in the first month, when it was overflowing its banks, and routed those living in all the valleys to the east and west.  
1Ch 12:16 Some from Benjamin and Judah also came to David’s stronghold.  
1Ch 12:17 David went out to meet them and said, “If you come to me in peace and want to help me, then I will make an alliance with you. But if you come to betray me to my enemies when I have not harmed you, may the God of our ancestors take notice and judge!”  
1Ch 12:18 But a spirit empowered Amasai, the leader of the thirty warriors, and he said: “We are yours, O David! We support you, O son of Jesse! May you greatly prosper! May those who help you prosper! Indeed your God helps you!”So David accepted them and made them leaders of raiding bands.  
1Ch 12:19 Some men from Manasseh joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (But in the end they did not help the Philistines because, after taking counsel, the Philistine lords sent David away, saying: “It would be disastrous for us if he deserts to his master Saul.”)  
1Ch 12:20 When David went to Ziklag, the men of Manasseh who joined him were Adnach, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders of a thousand soldiers each in the tribe of Manasseh.  
1Ch 12:21 They helped David fight against raiding bands, for all of them were warriors and leaders in the army.  
1Ch 12:22 Each day men came to help David until his army became very large.  
1Ch 12:23 The following is a record of the armed warriors who came with their leaders and joined David in Hebron in order to make David king in Saul’s place, in accordance with the Lord’s decree:  
1Ch 12:24 From Judah came 6,800 trained warriors carrying shields and spears.  
1Ch 12:25 From Simeon there were 7,100 warriors. 
1Ch 12:26 From Levi there were 4,600. 
1Ch 12:27 Jehoiada, the leader of Aaron’s descendants, brought 3,700 men with him, 
1Ch 12:28 along with Zadok, a young warrior, and twenty-two leaders from his family.  
1Ch 12:29 From Benjamin, Saul’s tribe, there were 3,000, most of whom, up to that time, had been loyal to Saul.  
1Ch 12:30 From Ephraim there were 20,800 warriors,  who had brought fame to their families.  
1Ch 12:31 From the half-tribe of Manasseh there were 18,000 who had been designated by name to come and make David king.  
1Ch 12:32 From Issachar there were 200 leaders and all their relatives at their command – they understood the times and knew what Israel should do.  
1Ch 12:33 From Zebulun there were 50,000 warriors who were prepared for battle, equipped with all kinds of weapons, and ready to give their undivided loyalty. 
1Ch 12:34 From Naphtali there were 1,000 officers,  along with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears.  
1Ch 12:35 From Dan there were 28,600 men prepared for battle.  
1Ch 12:36 From Asher there were 40,000 warriors prepared for battle.  
1Ch 12:37 From the other side of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 men armed with all kinds of weapons.  
1Ch 12:38 All these men were warriors who were ready to march. They came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel by acclamation; all the rest of the Israelites also were in agreement that David should become king.  
1Ch 12:39 They spent three days feasting there with David, for their relatives had given them provisions.  
1Ch 12:40 Also their neighbors, from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. There were large supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, beef, and lamb, for Israel was celebrating.  
1Ch 13:1 David consulted with his military officers, including those who led groups of a thousand and those who led groups of a hundred.  
1Ch 13:2 David said to the whole Israelite assembly, “If you so desire and the Lord our God approves, let’s spread the word to our brothers who remain in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites in their cities, so they may join us. 
1Ch 13:3 Let’s move the ark of our God back here, for we did not seek his will throughout Saul’s reign.”  
1Ch 13:4 The whole assembly agreed to do this, for the proposal seemed right to all the people.  
1Ch 13:5 So David assembled all Israel from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.  
1Ch 13:6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim) in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord, who sits enthroned between the cherubim – the ark that is called by his name.  
1Ch 13:7 They transported the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab; Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart,  
1Ch 13:8 while David and all Israel were energetically celebrating before God, singing and playing various stringed instruments, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.  
1Ch 13:9 When they arrived at the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to take hold of the ark, because the oxen stumbled.  
1Ch 13:10 The Lord was so furious with Uzzah, he killed him, because he reached out his hand and touched the ark. He died right there before God.  
1Ch 13:11 David was angry because the Lord attacked Uzzah; so he called that place Perez Uzzah, which remains its name to this very day.  
1Ch 13:12 David was afraid of God that day and said, “How will I ever be able to bring the ark of God up here?” 
1Ch 13:13 So David did not move the ark to the City of David; he left it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.  
1Ch 13:14 The ark of God remained in Obed-Edom’s house for three months; the Lord blessed Obed-Edom’s family and everything that belonged to him. 
1Ch 14:1 King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters to build a palace for him. 
1Ch 14:2 David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that he had elevated his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.  
1Ch 14:3 In Jerusalem David married more wives and fathered more sons and daughters.  
1Ch 14:4 These are the names of children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,  
1Ch 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,  
1Ch 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,  
1Ch 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.  
1Ch 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of all Israel, all the Philistines marched up to confront him. When David heard about it, he marched out against them. 
1Ch 14:9 Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim.  
1Ch 14:10 David asked God, “Should I march up against the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?” The Lord said to him, “March up! I will hand them over to you!”  
1Ch 14:11 So they marched against Baal Perazim and David defeated them there. David said, “Using me as his instrument, God has burst out against my enemies like water bursts out.” So that place is called Baal Perazim.  
1Ch 14:12 The Philistines left their idols there, so David ordered that they be burned.  
1Ch 14:13 The Philistines again raided the valley.  
1Ch 14:14 So David again asked God what he should do. This time God told him, “Don’t march up after them; circle around them and come against them in front of the trees.  
1Ch 14:15 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the trees, then attack. For at that moment God is going before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”  
1Ch 14:16 David did just as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.  
1Ch 14:17 So David became famous in all the lands; the Lord caused all the nations to fear him. 
1Ch 15:1 David constructed buildings in the City of David; he then prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 
1Ch 15:2 Then David said, “Only the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the Lord chose them to carry the ark of the Lord and to serve before him perpetually.”  
1Ch 15:3 David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of the Lord up to the place he had prepared for it. 
1Ch 15:4 David gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:  
1Ch 15:5 From the descendants of Kohath: Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives.  
1Ch 15:6 From the descendants of Merari: Asaiah the leader and 220 of his relatives.  
1Ch 15:7 From the descendants of Gershom: Joel the leader and 130 of his relatives.  
1Ch 15:8 From the descendants of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the leader and  200 of his relatives.  
1Ch 15:9 From the descendants of Hebron: Eliel the leader and 80 of his relatives.  
1Ch 15:10 From the descendants of Uzziel: Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.  
1Ch 15:11 David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.  
1Ch 15:12 He told them: “You are the leaders of the Levites’ families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves and bring the ark of the Lord God of Israel up to the place I have prepared for it. 
1Ch 15:13 The first time you did not carry it; that is why the Lord God attacked us, because we did not ask him about the proper way to carry it.” 
1Ch 15:14 The priests and Levites consecrated themselves so they could bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel.  
1Ch 15:15 The descendants of Levi carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, just as Moses had commanded in keeping with the Lord’s instruction. 
1Ch 15:16 David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint some of their relatives as musicians; they were to play various instruments, including stringed instruments and cymbals, and to sing loudly and joyfully.  
1Ch 15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; one of his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; one of the descendants of Merari, Ethan son of Kushaiah;  
1Ch 15:18 along with some of their relatives who were second in rank, including Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.  
1Ch 15:19 The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;  
1Ch 15:20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to the alamoth style; 
1Ch 15:21 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play the lyres according to the sheminith style, as led by the director;  
1Ch 15:22 Kenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was in charge of transport, for he was well-informed on this matter; 
1Ch 15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah were guardians of the ark;  
1Ch 15:24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; Obed-Edom and Jehiel were also guardians of the ark.  
1Ch 15:25 So David, the leaders of Israel, and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the Lord’s covenant from the house of Obed-Edom with celebration.  
1Ch 15:26 When God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the Lord’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.  
1Ch 15:27 David was wrapped in a linen robe, as were all the Levites carrying the ark, the musicians, and Kenaniah the supervisor of transport and the musicians; David also wore a linen ephod.  
1Ch 15:28 All Israel brought up the ark of the Lord’s covenant; they were shouting, blowing trumpets, sounding cymbals, and playing stringed instruments.  
1Ch 15:29 As the ark of the Lord’s covenant entered the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked out the window. When she saw King David jumping and celebrating, she despised him. 
1Ch 16:1 They brought the ark of God and put it in the middle of the tent David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.  
1Ch 16:2 When David finished offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the Lord’s name.  
1Ch 16:3 He then handed out to each Israelite man and woman a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.  
1Ch 16:4 He appointed some of the Levites to serve before the ark of the Lord, to offer prayers, songs of thanks, and hymns to the Lord God of Israel.  
1Ch 16:5 Asaph was the leader and Zechariah second in command, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They were to play stringed instruments; Asaph was to sound the cymbals;  
1Ch 16:6 and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of God’s covenant.  
1Ch 16:7 That day David first gave to Asaph and his colleagues this song of thanks to the Lord. 
1Ch 16:8 Give thanks to the Lord!Call on his name!Make known his accomplishments among the nations!  
1Ch 16:9 Sing to him! Make music to him!Tell about all his miraculous deeds! 
1Ch 16:10 Boast about his holy name!Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!  
1Ch 16:11 Seek the Lord and the strength he gives!Seek his presence continually!  
1Ch 16:12 Recall the miraculous deeds he performed,his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed,  
1Ch 16:13 O children of Israel, God’s servant,you descendants of Jacob, God’s chosen ones!  
1Ch 16:14 He is the Lord our God;he carries out judgment throughout the earth.  
1Ch 16:15 Remember continually his covenantal decree,the promise he made to a thousand generations – 
1Ch 16:16 the promise he made to Abraham,the promise he made by oath to Isaac!  
1Ch 16:17 He gave it to Jacob as a decree,to Israel as a lasting promise,  
1Ch 16:18 saying,  “To you I will give the land of Canaanas the portion of your inheritance.”  
1Ch 16:19 When they were few in number,just a very few, and foreign residents within it, 
1Ch 16:20 they wandered from nation to nation,and from one kingdom to another.  
1Ch 16:21 He let no one oppress them,he disciplined kings for their sake,  
1Ch 16:22 saying, “Don’t touch my anointed ones!Don’t harm my prophets!”  
1Ch 16:23 Sing to the Lord, all the earth!Announce every day how he delivers!  
1Ch 16:24 Tell the nations about his splendor,tell all the nations about his miraculous deeds! 
1Ch 16:25 For the Lord is great and certainly worthy of praise,he is more awesome than all gods.  
1Ch 16:26 For all the gods of the nations are worthless, but the Lord made the heavens.  
1Ch 16:27 Majestic splendor emanates from him, he is the source of strength and joy.  
1Ch 16:28 Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the nations,ascribe to the Lord splendor and strength!  
1Ch 16:29 Ascribe to the Lord the splendor he deserves! Bring an offering and enter his presence!Worship the Lord in holy attire!  
1Ch 16:30 Tremble before him, all the earth!The world is established, it cannot be moved.  
1Ch 16:31 Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be happy!Let the nations say, ‘The Lord reigns!’  
1Ch 16:32 Let the sea and everything in it shout!Let the fields and everything in them celebrate!  
1Ch 16:33 Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy before the Lord,for he comes to judge the earth!  
1Ch 16:34 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is goodand his loyal love endures.  
1Ch 16:35 Say this prayer: “Deliver us, O God who delivers us!Gather us! Rescue us from the nations!Then we will give thanks to your holy name,and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.” 
1Ch 16:36 May the Lord God of Israel be praised,in the future and forevermore. Then all the people said, “We agree! Praise the Lord. 
1Ch 16:37 David left Asaph and his colleagues there before the ark of the Lord’s covenant to serve before the ark regularly and fulfill each day’s requirements,  
1Ch 16:38 including Obed-Edom and sixty-eight colleagues. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were gatekeepers.  
1Ch 16:39 Zadok the priest and his fellow priests served before the Lord’s tabernacle at the worship center in Gibeon,  
1Ch 16:40 regularly offering burnt sacrifices to the Lord on the altar for burnt sacrifice, morning and evening, according to what is prescribed in the law of the Lord which he charged Israel to observe. 
1Ch 16:41 Joining them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the Lord. (For his loyal love endures!)  
1Ch 16:42 Heman and Jeduthun were in charge of the music, including the trumpets, cymbals, and the other musical instruments used in praising God. The sons of Jeduthun guarded the entrance.  
1Ch 16:43 Then all the people returned to their homes, and David went to pronounce a blessing on his family.  
1Ch 17:1 When David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a palace made from cedar, while the ark of the Lord’s covenant is under a tent.”  
1Ch 17:2 Nathan said to David, “You should do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you.” 
1Ch 17:3 That night God told Nathan, 
1Ch 17:4 “Go, tell my servant David: ‘This is what the Lord says: “You must not build me a house in which to live.  
1Ch 17:5 For I have not lived in a house from the time I brought Israel up from Egypt to the present day. I have lived in a tent that has been in various places.  
1Ch 17:6 Wherever I moved throughout Israel, I did not say to any of the leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, ‘Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?’”’  
1Ch 17:7  “So now, say this to my servant David: ‘This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says: “I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you a leader of my people Israel.  
1Ch 17:8 I was with you wherever you went and I defeated all your enemies before you. Now I will make you as famous as the great men of the earth.  
1Ch 17:9 I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle them there; they will live there and not be disturbed anymore. Violent men will not oppress them again, as they did in the beginning  
1Ch 17:10 and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies.“‘“I declare to you that the Lord will build a dynastic house for you! 
1Ch 17:11 When the time comes for you to die, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom.  
1Ch 17:12 He will build me a house, and I will make his dynasty permanent.  
1Ch 17:13 I will become his father and he will become my son. I will never withhold my loyal love from him, as I withheld it from the one who ruled before you. 
1Ch 17:14 I will put him in permanent charge of my house and my kingdom; his dynasty will be permanent.”’”  
1Ch 17:15 Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him. 
1Ch 17:16 King David went in, sat before the Lord, and said: “Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you should have brought me to this point?  
1Ch 17:17 And you did not stop there, O God! You have also spoken about the future of your servant’s family. You have revealed to me what men long to know, O Lord God.  
1Ch 17:18 What more can David say to you? You have honored your servant; you have given your servant special recognition.  
1Ch 17:19 O Lord, for the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing in order to reveal your greatness.  
1Ch 17:20 O Lord, there is none like you; there is no God besides you! What we heard is true! 
1Ch 17:21 And who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation in the earth? Their God went to claim a nation for himself! You made a name for yourself by doing great and awesome deeds when you drove out nations before your people whom you had delivered from the Egyptian empire and its gods. 
1Ch 17:22 You made Israel your very own nation for all time. You, O Lord, became their God.  
1Ch 17:23 So now, O Lord, may the promise you made about your servant and his family become a permanent reality! Do as you promised,  
1Ch 17:24 so it may become a reality and you may gain lasting fame, as people say, ‘The Lord of Heaven’s Armies is the God of Israel.’ The dynasty of your servant David will be established before you, 
1Ch 17:25 for you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a dynasty for him. That is why your servant has had the courage to pray to you.  
1Ch 17:26 Now, O Lord, you are the true God; you have made this good promise to your servant.  
1Ch 17:27 Now you are willing to bless your servant’s dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O Lord, have blessed it and it will be blessed from now on into the future.”  
1Ch 18:1 Later David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. He took Gath and its surrounding towns away from the Philistines.  
1Ch 18:2 He defeated the Moabites; the Moabites became David’s subjects and brought tribute.  
1Ch 18:3 David defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah as far as Hamath, when he went to extend his authority to the Euphrates River.  
1Ch 18:4 David seized from him 1,000 chariots,  7,000 charioteers, and 20,000 infantrymen . David cut the hamstrings of all but a hundred of Hadadezer’s chariot horses.  
1Ch 18:5 The Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, but David killed 22,000 of the Arameans.  
1Ch 18:6 David placed garrisons in the territory of the Arameans of Damascus; the Arameans became David’s subjects and brought tribute. The Lord protected David wherever he campaigned.  
1Ch 18:7 David took the golden shields which Hadadezer’s servants had carried and brought them to Jerusalem.  
1Ch 18:8 From Tibhath and Kun, Hadadezer’s cities, David took a great deal of bronze. (Solomon used it to make the big bronze basin called “The Sea,” the pillars, and other bronze items.)  
1Ch 18:9 When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah,  
1Ch 18:10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David to extend his best wishes and to pronounce a blessing on him for his victory over Hadadezer, for Tou had been at war with Hadadezer. He also sent various items made of gold, silver, and bronze.  
1Ch 18:11 King David dedicated these things to the Lord, along with the silver and gold which he had carried off from all the nations, including Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.  
1Ch 18:12 Abishai son of Zeruiah killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.  
1Ch 18:13 He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. The Lord protected David wherever he campaigned.  
1Ch 18:14 David reigned over all Israel; he guaranteed justice for all his people.  
1Ch 18:15 Joab son of Zeruiah was commanding general of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was secretary;  
1Ch 18:16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was scribe;  
1Ch 18:17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada supervised the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were the king’s leading officials. 
1Ch 19:1 Later King Nahash of the Ammonites died and his son succeeded him. 
1Ch 19:2 David said, “I will express my loyalty to Hanun son of Nahash, for his father was loyal to me.” So David sent messengers to express his sympathy over his father’s death. When David’s servants entered Ammonite territory to visit Hanun and express the king’s sympathy, 
1Ch 19:3 the Ammonite officials said to Hanun, “Do you really think David is trying to honor your father by sending these messengers to express his sympathy? No, his servants have come to you so they can get information and spy out the land!”  
1Ch 19:4 So Hanun seized David’s servants and shaved their beards off. He cut off the lower part of their robes so that their buttocks were exposed and then sent them away.  
1Ch 19:5 People came and told David what had happened to the men, so he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were thoroughly humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow again; then you may come back.”  
1Ch 19:6 When the Ammonites realized that David was disgusted with them, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah, and Zobah.  
1Ch 19:7 They hired 32,000 chariots,  along with the king of Maacah and his army, who came and camped in front of Medeba. The Ammonites also assembled from their cities and marched out to do battle.  
1Ch 19:8 When David heard the news, he sent Joab and the entire army to meet them. 
1Ch 19:9 The Ammonites marched out and were deployed for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.  
1Ch 19:10 When Joab saw that the battle would be fought on two fronts, he chose some of Israel’s best men and deployed them against the Arameans.  
1Ch 19:11 He put his brother Abishai in charge of the rest of the army and they were deployed against the Ammonites.  
1Ch 19:12 Joab said, “If the Arameans start to overpower me, you come to my rescue. If the Ammonites start to overpower you, I will come to your rescue.  
1Ch 19:13 Be strong! Let’s fight bravely for the sake of our people and the cities of our God! The Lord will do what he decides is best!”  
1Ch 19:14 So Joab and his men marched toward the Arameans to do battle, and they fled before him. 
1Ch 19:15 When the Ammonites saw the Arameans flee, they fled before Joab’s brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Joab went back to Jerusalem.  
1Ch 19:16 When the Arameans realized they had been defeated by Israel, they sent for reinforcements from beyond the Euphrates River, led by Shophach the commanding general of Hadadezer’s army.  
1Ch 19:17 When David was informed, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and marched against them. David deployed his army against the Arameans for battle and they fought against him. 
1Ch 19:18 The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 infantrymen; he also killed Shophach the commanding general.  
1Ch 19:19 When Hadadezer’s subjects saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. The Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.  
1Ch 20:1 In the spring, at the time when kings normally conduct wars, Joab led the army into battle and devastated the land of the Ammonites. He went and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab defeated Rabbah and tore it down.  
1Ch 20:2 David took the crown from the head of their king and wore it (its weight was a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones). He took a large amount of plunder from the city.  
1Ch 20:3 He removed the city’s residents and made them labor with saws, iron picks, and axes. This was his policy with all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.  
1Ch 20:4 Later there was a battle with the Philistines in Gezer. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.  
1Ch 20:5 There was another battle with the Philistines in which Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft as big as the crossbeam of a weaver’s loom. 
1Ch 20:6 In a battle in Gath there was a large man who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot – twenty-four in all! He too was a descendant of Rapha.  
1Ch 20:7 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him. 
1Ch 20:8 These were the descendants of Rapha who lived in Gath; they were killed by the hand of David and his soldiers.  
1Ch 21:1 An adversary opposed Israel, inciting David to count how many warriors Israel had. 
1Ch 21:2 David told Joab and the leaders of the army, “Go, count the number of warriors from Beer Sheba to Dan. Then bring back a report to me so I may know how many we have.” 
1Ch 21:3 Joab replied, “May the Lord make his army a hundred times larger! My master, O king, do not all of them serve my master? Why does my master want to do this? Why bring judgment on Israel?”  
1Ch 21:4 But the king’s edict stood, despite Joab’s objections. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel before returning to Jerusalem.  
1Ch 21:5 Joab reported to David the number of warriors. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 sword-wielding soldiers; Judah alone had 470,000 sword-wielding soldiers.  
1Ch 21:6 Now Joab did not number Levi and Benjamin, for the king’s edict disgusted him.  
1Ch 21:7 God was also offended by it, so he attacked Israel.  
1Ch 21:8 David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this! Now, please remove the guilt of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”  
1Ch 21:9 The Lord told Gad, David’s prophet,  
1Ch 21:10 “Go, tell David, ‘This is what the Lord says: “I am offering you three forms of judgment from which to choose. Pick one of them.”’” 
1Ch 21:11 Gad went to David and told him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Pick one of these: 
1Ch 21:12 three years of famine, or three months being chased by your enemies and struck down by their swords, or three days being struck down by the Lord, during which a plague will invade the land and the Lord’s angel will destroy throughout Israel’s territory.’ Now, decide what I should tell the one who sent me.” 
1Ch 21:13 David said to Gad, “I am very upset! I prefer to be attacked by the Lord, for his mercy is very great; I do not want to be attacked by men!”  
1Ch 21:14 So the Lord sent a plague through Israel, and 70,000 Israelite men died.  
1Ch 21:15 God sent an angel to ravage Jerusalem. As he was doing so, the Lord watched and relented from his judgment. He told the angel who was destroying, “That’s enough! Stop now!” Now the Lord’s angel was standing near the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  
1Ch 21:16 David looked up and saw the Lord’s angel standing between the earth and sky with his sword drawn and in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. David and the leaders, covered with sackcloth, threw themselves down with their faces to the ground. 
1Ch 21:17 David said to God, “Was I not the one who decided to number the army? I am the one who sinned and committed this awful deed! As for these sheep – what have they done? O Lord my God, attack me and my family, but remove the plague from your people!”  
1Ch 21:18 So the Lord’s angel told Gad to instruct David to go up and build an altar for the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  
1Ch 21:19 So David went up as Gad instructed him to do in the name of the Lord.  
1Ch 21:20 While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the messenger, and he and his four sons hid themselves. 
1Ch 21:21 When David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David; he came out from the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.  
1Ch 21:22 David said to Ornan, “Sell me the threshing floor so I can build on it an altar for the Lord – I’ll pay top price – so that the plague may be removed from the people.”  
1Ch 21:23 Ornan told David, “You can have it! My master, the king, may do what he wants. Look, I am giving you the oxen for burnt sacrifices, the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for an offering. I give it all to you.” 
1Ch 21:24 King David replied to Ornan, “No, I insist on buying it for top price. I will not offer to the Lord what belongs to you or offer a burnt sacrifice that cost me nothing. 
1Ch 21:25 So David bought the place from Ornan for 600 pieces of gold.  
1Ch 21:26 David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings. He called out to the Lord, and the Lord responded by sending fire from the sky and consuming the burnt sacrifice on the altar.  
1Ch 21:27 The Lord ordered the messenger to put his sword back into its sheath.  
1Ch 21:28 At that time, when David saw that the Lord responded to him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.  
1Ch 21:29 Now the Lord’s tabernacle (which Moses had made in the wilderness) and the altar for burnt sacrifices were at that time at the worship center in Gibeon.  
1Ch 21:30 But David could not go before it to seek God’s will, for he was afraid of the sword of the Lord’s angel.  
1Ch 22:1 David then said, “This is the place where the temple of the Lord God will be, along with the altar for burnt sacrifices for Israel.”  
1Ch 22:2 David ordered the resident foreigners in the land of Israel to be called together. He appointed some of them to be stonecutters to chisel stones for the building of God’s temple.  
1Ch 22:3 David supplied a large amount of iron for the nails of the doors of the gates and for braces, more bronze than could be weighed,  
1Ch 22:4 and more cedar logs than could be counted. (The Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large amount of cedar logs to David.)  
1Ch 22:5 David said, “My son Solomon is just an inexperienced young man, and the temple to be built for the Lord must be especially magnificent so it will become famous and be considered splendid by all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for its construction.” So David made extensive preparations before he died.  
1Ch 22:6 He summoned his son Solomon and charged him to build a temple for the Lord God of Israel.  
1Ch 22:7 David said to Solomon: “My son, I really wanted to build a temple to honor the Lord my God.  
1Ch 22:8 But this was the Lord’s message to me: ‘You have spilled a great deal of blood and fought many battles. You must not build a temple to honor me, for you have spilled a great deal of blood on the ground before me. 
1Ch 22:9 Look, you will have a son, who will be a peaceful man. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. Indeed, Solomon will be his name; I will give Israel peace and quiet during his reign. 
1Ch 22:10 He will build a temple to honor me; he will become my son, and I will become his father. I will grant to his dynasty permanent rule over Israel.’  
1Ch 22:11  “Now, my son, may the Lord be with you! May you succeed and build a temple for the Lord your God, just as he announced you would. 
1Ch 22:12 Only may the Lord give you insight and understanding when he places you in charge of Israel, so you may obey the law of the Lord your God.  
1Ch 22:13 Then you will succeed, if you carefully obey the rules and regulations which the Lord ordered Moses to give to Israel. Be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic!  
1Ch 22:14 Now, look, I have made every effort to supply what is needed to build the Lord’s temple. I have stored up 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and so much bronze and iron it cannot be weighed, as well as wood and stones. Feel free to add more!  
1Ch 22:15 You also have available many workers, including stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and an innumerable array of workers who are skilled 
1Ch 22:16 in using gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Get up and begin the work! May the Lord be with you!” 
1Ch 22:17 David ordered all the officials of Israel to support his son Solomon.  
1Ch 22:18 He told them, “The Lord your God is with you! He has made you secure on every side, for he handed over to me the inhabitants of the region and the region is subdued before the Lord and his people.  
1Ch 22:19 Now seek the Lord your God wholeheartedly and with your entire being! Get up and build the sanctuary of the Lord God! Then you can bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant and the holy items dedicated to God’s service into the temple that is built to honor the Lord.”  
1Ch 23:1 When David was old and approaching the end of his life, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.  
1Ch 23:2 David assembled all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and the Levites.  
1Ch 23:3 The Levites who were thirty years old and up were counted; there were 38,000 men.  
1Ch 23:4 David said, “Of these, 24,000 are to direct the work of the Lord’s temple; 6,000 are to be officials and judges;  
1Ch 23:5 4,000 are to be gatekeepers; and 4,000 are to praise the Lord with the instruments I supplied for worship.” 
1Ch 23:6 David divided them into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.  
1Ch 23:7 The Gershonites included Ladan and Shimei.  
1Ch 23:8 The sons of Ladan:Jehiel the oldest, Zetham, and Joel – three in all. 
1Ch 23:9 The sons of Shimei:Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran – three in all.These were the leaders of the family of Ladan.  
1Ch 23:10 The sons of Shimei:Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These were Shimei’s sons – four in all. 
1Ch 23:11 Jahath was the oldest and Zizah the second oldest. Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were considered one family with one responsibility.  
1Ch 23:12 The sons of Kohath:Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel – four in all. 
1Ch 23:13 The sons of Amram:Aaron and Moses.Aaron and his descendants were chosen on a permanent basis to consecrate the most holy items, to offer sacrifices before the Lord, to serve him, and to praise his name.  
1Ch 23:14 The descendants of Moses the man of God were considered Levites.  
1Ch 23:15 The sons of Moses:Gershom and Eliezer.  
1Ch 23:16 The son of Gershom:Shebuel the oldest.  
1Ch 23:17 The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah, the oldest. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants.  
1Ch 23:18 The son of Izhar:Shelomith the oldest.  
1Ch 23:19 The sons of Hebron:Jeriah the oldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  
1Ch 23:20 The sons of Uzziel:Micah the oldest, and Isshiah the second.  
1Ch 23:21 The sons of Merari:Mahli and Mushi.The sons of Mahli:Eleazar and Kish.  
1Ch 23:22 Eleazar died without having sons; he had only daughters. The sons of Kish, their cousins, married them. 
1Ch 23:23 The sons of Mushi:Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth – three in all. 
1Ch 23:24 These were the descendants of Levi according to their families, that is, the leaders of families as counted and individually listed who carried out assigned tasks in the Lord’s temple and were twenty years old and up.  
1Ch 23:25 For David said, “The Lord God of Israel has given his people rest and has permanently settled in Jerusalem.  
1Ch 23:26 So the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the items used in its service.”  
1Ch 23:27 According to David’s final instructions, the Levites twenty years old and up were counted.  
1Ch 23:28 Their job was to help Aaron’s descendants in the service of the Lord’s temple. They were to take care of the courtyards, the rooms, ceremonial purification of all holy items, and other jobs related to the service of God’s temple.  
1Ch 23:29 They also took care of the bread that is displayed, the flour for offerings, the unleavened wafers, the round cakes, the mixing, and all the measuring.  
1Ch 23:30 They also stood in a designated place every morning and offered thanks and praise to the Lord. They also did this in the evening  
1Ch 23:31 and whenever burnt sacrifices were offered to the Lord on the Sabbath and at new moon festivals and assemblies. A designated number were to serve before the Lord regularly in accordance with regulations.  
1Ch 23:32 They were in charge of the meeting tent and the holy place, and helped their relatives, the descendants of Aaron, in the service of the Lord’s temple.  
1Ch 24:1 The divisions of Aaron’s descendants were as follows:The sons of Aaron:Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  
1Ch 24:2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father did; they had no sons. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 
1Ch 24:3 David,  Zadok (a descendant of Eleazar), and Ahimelech (a descendant of Ithamar) divided them into groups to carry out their assigned responsibilities.  
1Ch 24:4 The descendants of Eleazar had more leaders than the descendants of Ithamar, so they divided them up accordingly; the descendants of Eleazar had sixteen leaders, while the descendants of Ithamar had eight.  
1Ch 24:5 They divided them by lots, for there were officials of the holy place and officials designated by God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.  
1Ch 24:6 The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote down their names before the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and Levite families. One family was drawn by lot from Eleazar, and then the next from Ithamar.  
1Ch 24:7 The first lot went to Jehoiarib,the second to Jedaiah,  
1Ch 24:8 the third to Harim,the fourth to Seorim,  
1Ch 24:9 the fifth to Malkijah,the sixth to Mijamin,  
1Ch 24:10 the seventh to Hakkoz,the eighth to Abijah,  
1Ch 24:11 the ninth to Jeshua,the tenth to Shecaniah,  
1Ch 24:12 the eleventh to Eliashib,the twelfth to Jakim,  
1Ch 24:13 the thirteenth to Huppah,the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,  
1Ch 24:14 the fifteenth to Bilgah,the sixteenth to Immer,  
1Ch 24:15 the seventeenth to Hezir,the eighteenth to Happizzez,  
1Ch 24:16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah,the twentieth to Jehezkel,  
1Ch 24:17 the twenty-first to Jakin,the twenty-second to Gamul,  
1Ch 24:18 the twenty-third to Delaiah,the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.  
1Ch 24:19 This was the order in which they carried out their assigned responsibilities when they entered the Lord’s temple, according to the regulations given them by their ancestor Aaron, just as the Lord God of Israel had instructed him. 
1Ch 24:20 The rest of the Levites included: Shubael from the sons of Amram,Jehdeiah from the sons of Shubael,  
1Ch 24:21 the firstborn Isshiah from Rehabiah and the sons of Rehabiah,  
1Ch 24:22 Shelomoth from the Izharites,Jahath from the sons of Shelomoth.  
1Ch 24:23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.  
1Ch 24:24 The son of Uzziel:Micah;Shamir from the sons of Micah.  
1Ch 24:25 The brother of Micah:Isshiah.Zechariah from the sons of Isshiah.  
1Ch 24:26 The sons of Merari:Mahli and Mushi.The son of Jaaziah:Beno.  
1Ch 24:27 The sons of Merari, from Jaaziah:Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.  
1Ch 24:28 From Mahli:Eleazar, who had no sons.  
1Ch 24:29 From Kish:Jerahmeel.  
1Ch 24:30 The sons of Mushi:Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.These were the Levites, listed by their families.  
1Ch 24:31 Just like their relatives, the descendants of Aaron, they also cast lots before King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, the leaders of families, the priests, and the Levites. The families of the oldest son cast lots along with those of the youngest.  
1Ch 25:1 David and the army officers selected some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to prophesy as they played stringed instruments and cymbals. The following men were assigned this responsibility:  
1Ch 25:2 From the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. The sons of Asaph were supervised by Asaph, who prophesied under the king’s supervision.  
1Ch 25:3 From the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah – six in all, under supervision of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied as he played a harp, giving thanks and praise to the Lord.

1Ch 25:5 All these were the sons of Heman, the king’s prophet. God had promised him these sons in order to make him prestigious. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.  
1Ch 25:6 All of these were under the supervision of their fathers; they were musicians in the Lord’s temple, playing cymbals and stringed instruments as they served in God’s temple. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the supervision of the king.  
1Ch 25:7 They and their relatives, all of them skilled and trained to make music to the Lord, numbered two hundred eighty-eight.  
1Ch 25:8 They cast lots to determine their responsibilities – oldest as well as youngest, teacher as well as student.  
1Ch 25:9 The first lot went to Asaph’s son Joseph and his relatives and sons – twelve in all, the second to Gedaliah and his relatives and sons – twelve in all, 
1Ch 25:10 the third to Zaccur and his sons and relatives – twelve in all,

1Ch 26:1 The divisions of the gatekeepers:From the Korahites: Meshelemiah, son of Kore, one of the sons of Asaph.  
1Ch 26:2 Meshelemiah’s sons:The firstborn Zechariah, the second Jediael, the third Zebadiah, the fourth Jathniel,  
1Ch 26:3 the fifth Elam, the sixth Jehohanan, and the seventh Elihoenai.

1Ch 26:5 the sixth Ammiel, the seventh Issachar, and the eighth Peullethai. (Indeed, God blessed Obed-Edom.) 
1Ch 26:6 His son Shemaiah also had sons, who were leaders of their families, for they were highly respected.  
1Ch 26:7 The sons of Shemaiah:Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad. His relatives Elihu and Semakiah were also respected.  
1Ch 26:8 All these were the descendants of Obed-Edom. They and their sons and relatives were respected men, capable of doing their responsibilities. There were sixty-two of them related to Obed-Edom.

1Ch 28:3 But God said to me, ‘You must not build a temple to honor me, for you are a warrior and have spilled blood.’  
1Ch 28:4 The Lord God of Israel chose me out of my father’s entire family to become king over Israel and have a permanent dynasty. Indeed, he chose Judah as leader, and my father’s family within Judah, and then he picked me out from among my father’s sons and made me king over all Israel.  
1Ch 28:5 From all the many sons the Lord has given me, he chose Solomon my son to rule on his behalf over Israel.  
1Ch 28:6 He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build my temple and my courts, for I have chosen him to become my son and I will become his father.  
1Ch 28:7 I will establish his kingdom permanently, if he remains committed to obeying my commands and regulations, as you are doing this day.’  
1Ch 28:8 So now, in the sight of all Israel, the Lord’s assembly, and in the hearing of our God, I say this: Carefully observe all the commands of the Lord your God, so that you may possess this good land and may leave it as a permanent inheritance for your children after you. 
1Ch 28:9  “And you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father and serve him with a submissive attitude and a willing spirit, for the Lord examines all minds and understands every motive of one’s thoughts. If you seek him, he will let you find him, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.  
1Ch 28:10 Realize now that the Lord has chosen you to build a temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it!” 
1Ch 28:11 David gave to his son Solomon the blueprints for the temple porch, its buildings, its treasuries, its upper areas, its inner rooms, and the room for atonement.

1Ch 28:13 He gave him the regulations for the divisions of priests and Levites, for all the assigned responsibilities within the Lord’s temple, and for all the items used in the service of the Lord’s temple.  
1Ch 28:14 He gave him the prescribed weight for all the gold items to be used in various types of service in the Lord’s temple, for all the silver items to be used in various types of service,  
1Ch 28:15 for the gold lampstands and their gold lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps, for the silver lampstands, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps, according to the prescribed use of each lampstand,  
1Ch 28:16 for the gold used in the display tables, including the amount to be used in each table, for the silver to be used in the silver tables,  
1Ch 28:17 for the pure gold used for the meat forks, bowls, and jars, for the small gold bowls, including the weight for each bowl, for the small silver bowls, including the weight for each bowl,  
1Ch 28:18 and for the refined gold of the incense altar.He gave him the blueprint for the seat of the gold cherubim that spread their wings and provide shelter for the ark of the Lord’s covenant.  
1Ch 28:19 David said, “All of this I put in writing as the Lord directed me and gave me insight regarding the details of the blueprints.”  
1Ch 28:20 David said to his son Solomon: “Be strong and brave! Do it! Don’t be afraid and don’t panic! For the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not leave you or abandon you before all the work for the service of the Lord’s temple is finished.  
1Ch 28:21 Here are the divisions of the priests and Levites who will perform all the service of God’s temple. All the willing and skilled men are ready to assist you in all the work and perform their service. The officials and all the people are ready to follow your instructions.”  
1Ch 29:1 King David said to the entire assembly: “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is just an inexperienced young man, and the task is great, for this palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.  
1Ch 29:2 So I have made every effort to provide what is needed for the temple of my God, including the gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, as well as a large amount of onyx, settings of antimony and other stones, all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster.  
1Ch 29:3 Now, to show my commitment to the temple of my God, I donate my personal treasure of gold and silver to the temple of my God, in addition to all that I have already supplied for this holy temple.  
1Ch 29:4 This includes 3,000 talents of gold from Ophir and 7,000 talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the buildings,  
1Ch 29:5 for gold and silver items, and for all the work of the craftsmen. Who else wants to contribute to the Lord today?”  
1Ch 29:6 The leaders of the families, the leaders of the Israelite tribes, the commanders of units of a thousand and a hundred, and the supervisors of the king’s work contributed willingly.  
1Ch 29:7 They donated for the service of God’s temple 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron.  
1Ch 29:8 All who possessed precious stones donated them to the treasury of the Lord’s temple, which was under the supervision of Jehiel the Gershonite.  
1Ch 29:9 The people were delighted with their donations, for they contributed to the Lord with a willing attitude; King David was also very happy.  
1Ch 29:10 David praised the Lord before the entire assembly: “O Lord God of our father Israel, you deserve praise forevermore!  
1Ch 29:11 O Lord, you are great, mighty, majestic, magnificent, glorious, and sovereign over all the sky and earth! You,  Lord, have dominion and exalt yourself as the ruler of all.  
1Ch 29:12 You are the source of wealth and honor; you rule over all. You possess strength and might to magnify and give strength to all.  
1Ch 29:13 Now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your majestic name!  
1Ch 29:14  “But who am I and who are my people, that we should be in a position to contribute this much? Indeed, everything comes from you, and we have simply given back to you what is yours. 
1Ch 29:15 For we are resident foreigners and temporary settlers in your presence, like all our ancestors; our days are like a shadow on the earth, without security.  
1Ch 29:16 O Lord our God, all this wealth, which we have collected to build a temple for you to honor your holy name, comes from you; it all belongs to you. 
1Ch 29:17 I know, my God, that you examine thoughts and are pleased with integrity. With pure motives I contribute all this; and now I look with joy as your people who have gathered here contribute to you.  
1Ch 29:18 O Lord God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, always maintain these motives of your people and keep them devoted to you. 
1Ch 29:19 Make my son Solomon willing to obey your commands, rules, and regulations, and to complete building the palace for which I have made preparations.”  
1Ch 29:20 David told the entire assembly: “Praise the Lord your God!” So the entire assembly praised the Lord God of their ancestors; they bowed down and stretched out flat on the ground before the Lord and the king.  
1Ch 29:21 The next day they made sacrifices and offered burnt sacrifices to the Lord (1,000 bulls,  1,000 rams,  1,000 lambs), along with their accompanying drink offerings and many other sacrifices for all Israel.  
1Ch 29:22 They held a feast before the Lord that day and celebrated. Then they designated Solomon, David’s son, as king a second time; before the Lord they anointed him as ruler and Zadok as priest.  
1Ch 29:23 Solomon sat on the Lord’s throne as king in place of his father David; he was successful and all Israel was loyal to him.  
1Ch 29:24 All the officers and warriors, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.  
1Ch 29:25 The Lord greatly magnified Solomon before all Israel and bestowed on him greater majesty than any king of Israel before him. 
1Ch 29:26 David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.  
1Ch 29:27 He reigned over Israel forty years; he reigned in Hebron seven years and in Jerusalem thirty-three years.  
1Ch 29:28 He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth, and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him. 
1Ch 29:29 King David’s accomplishments, from start to finish, are recorded in the Annals of Samuel the prophet, the Annals of Nathan the prophet, and the Annals of Gad the prophet.  
1Ch 29:30 Recorded there are all the facts about his reign and accomplishments, and an account of the events that involved him, Israel, and all the neighboring kingdoms.
