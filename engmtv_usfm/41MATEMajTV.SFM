\s1 The Genealogy of Jesus
\p
\v 1 The record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:
\v 2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac was the father of Jacob, and Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
\v 3 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron was the father of Ram.
\v 4 Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
\v 5 Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, Obed was the father of Jesse,
\v 6 and Jesse was the father of David the king. David the king was the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
\v 7 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Asa.
\v 8 Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram, and Joram was the father of Uzziah.
\v 9 Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
\v 10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
\v 11 Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the captivity in Babylon.
\v 12 And after the captivity in Babylon, Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
\v 13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, Abiud was the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim was the father of Azor.
\v 14 Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok was the father of Achim, and Achim was the father of Eliud.
\v 15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar was the father of Matthan, and Matthan was the father of Jacob.
\v 16 And Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.
\v 17 So all the generations from Abraham till David were fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon were fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ were fourteen generations.
\s1 The Birth of Jesus
\p
\v 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Then Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wanting to disgrace her, purposed to put her away secretly.
\v 20 But while he was thinking about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 And she shall bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins."
\v 22 Now all this came to pass so that the thing spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
\v 23 "BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD, AND SHALL BRING FORTH A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL," which is translated, "God with us."
\v 24 Then Joseph, having been aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had ordered him and took Mary as his wife,
\v 25 but did not know her till she brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus.
\c 2
\s1 The Visit of the Wise Men
\p
\v 1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East arrived in Jerusalem,
\v 2 saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him."
\v 3 But when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
\v 4 And having gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ would be born.
\v 5 So they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:
\v 6 'BUT YOU, BETHLEHEM, IN THE LAND OF JUDAH, ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST AMONG THE RULERS OF JUDAH; FOR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A RULER WHO WILL SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL.' "
\v 7 Then Herod, secretly having called the wise men, ascertained from them the time that the star appeared.
\v 8 And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, "Go and search diligently for the young Child, and as soon as you find Him, report back to me, so that I also may come and worship Him."
\v 9 When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.
\v 10 And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
\v 11 And having come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and falling down, they worshiped Him, and opening their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by another way.
\s1 The Escape to Egypt
\p
\v 13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up, and take the young Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to seek the young Child to destroy Him."
\v 14 So Joseph got up and took the young Child and His mother by night and departed to Egypt,
\v 15 and remained there until the death of Herod, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "OUT OF EGYPT I CALLED MY SON."
\s1 The Massacre of the Infants
\p
\v 16 Then Herod, seeing that he had been deceived by the wise men, was greatly enraged; and he sent and executed all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.
\v 17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
\v 18 "A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, LAMENTATION AND WEEPING, AND GREAT MOURNING, RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN, REFUSING TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY ARE NO MORE."
\s1 The Return from Egypt
\p
\v 19 Now after Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\v 20 saying, "Get up, and take the young Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the young Child have died."
\v 21 So Joseph got up and took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew into the regions of Galilee.
\v 23 And when he arrived, he settled down in a city called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
\c 3
\s1 John the Baptist Prepares the Way
\p
\v 1 Now in those days John the Baptist arrived preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
\v 2 and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"
\v 3 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: "A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS: 'PREPARE THE WAY OF THE LORD; MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.' "
\v 4 Now John himself had a garment made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan were going out to him,
\v 6 and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
\v 7 But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
\v 8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance,
\v 9 and do not think to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.
\v 10 But even now, the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
\v 11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit,
\v 12 whose winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and He will gather His wheat into the barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."
\s1 The Baptism of Jesus
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus arrived from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him.
\v 14 But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?"
\v 15 But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he permitted Him.
\v 16 And having been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on Him.
\v 17 And behold, a voice came out of the heavens, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
\c 4
\s1 The Temptation of Jesus
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.
\v 3 And the tempter came and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
\v 4 But He answered and said, "It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE, BUT BY EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.' "
\v 5 Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
\v 6 and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: 'HE SHALL GIVE HIS ANGELS CHARGE CONCERNING YOU,' and, 'ON THEIR HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, LEST YOU DASH YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.' "
\v 7 Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'YOU SHALL NOT TEMPT THE LORD YOUR GOD.' "
\v 8 Again, the devil took Him up on a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
\v 9 And he said to Him, "All these things will I give You, if You fall down and worship me."
\v 10 Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND HIM ALONE YOU SHALL SERVE.' "
\v 11 Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.
\s1 Jesus Begins His Ministry in Galilee
\p
\v 12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, He departed into Galilee.
\v 13 And leaving Nazareth behind, He came and settled down in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
\v 14 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
\v 15 "THE LAND OF ZEBULUN AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI, BY THE WAY OF THE SEA, BEYOND THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES,
\v 16 THE PEOPLE SITTING IN DARKNESS HAVE SEEN A GREAT LIGHT, AND TO THOSE WHO SAT IN THE LAND AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH, LIGHT HAS DAWNED."
\v 17 From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
\s1 Jesus Calls the First Disciples
\p
\v 18 Now as He was walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
\v 19 Then He said to them, "Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
\v 20 They immediately left their nets and followed Him.
\v 21 Going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.
\v 22 And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
\s1 Jesus Ministers to the Multitudes
\p
\v 23 And Jesus went about all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every kind of sickness among the people.
\v 24 And the report of Him went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all those who were ill, and who were suffering with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.
\v 25 And large crowds followed Him from Galilee and from Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
\c 5
\s1 The Beatitudes
\p
\v 1 And seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain, and after He had sat down, His disciples approached Him.
\v 2 And opening His mouth, He began to teach them, saying:
\v 3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
\v 5 Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
\v 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
\v 10 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 11 "Blessed are you whenever they revile you, and they persecute you, and they say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.
\v 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
\s1 Believers Are Salt and Light
\p
\v 13 "You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is then good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trampled underfoot by men.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
\v 15 Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on everything in the house.
\v 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
\s1 The Law and the Prophets
\p
\v 17 "Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
\v 18 For assuredly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one tittle shall by no means pass away from the law until all things are fulfilled.
\v 19 Whoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 20 For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
\s1 Concerning Anger
\p
\v 21 "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'YOU SHALL NOT MURDER,' and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.
\v 22 But I say to you that whoever gets angry with his brother without cause will be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Empty-head!' will be in danger of the council. But whoever says, ' fool!' will be in danger of hell fire.
\v 23 Therefore if you offer your gift on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
\v 24 leave your gift there before the altar, and go, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
\v 25 Make friends with your adversary quickly, while you are on the road with him, lest your adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
\v 26 Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.
\s1 Concerning Adultery
\p
\v 27 "You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.'
\v 28 But I say to you, that whoever looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
\v 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
\s1 Concerning Divorce
\p
\v 31 "Furthermore it has been said, 'WHOEVER DIVORCES HIS WIFE, LET HIM GIVE HER A DIVORCE CERTIFICATE.'
\v 32 "But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorcee commits adultery.
\s1 Concerning Oaths
\p
\v 33 "Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'YOU SHALL NOT SWEAR FALSELY, BUT YOU SHALL PAY YOUR OATHS TO THE LORD.'
\v 34 "But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
\v 36 Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let what you say be simply “Yes” or “No”; for whatever is more than these is from the evil one.
\s1 Concerning Retaliation
\p
\v 38 "You have heard that it was said, 'AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.'
\v 39 But I say to you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
\v 40 And to the one desiring to sue you and to take your tunic, let him have your cloak also.
\v 41 And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
\v 42 Give to the one asking you, and to the one desiring to borrow from you, do not turn away.
\s1 Love for Enemies
\p
\v 43 "You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR, and you shall hate your enemy.'
\v 44 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,
\v 45 so that you may prove to be sons of your Father in heaven; because He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and He sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
\v 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 47 And if you greet your friends only, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 48 You therefore be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.
\c 6
\s1 Concerning Almsgiving
\p
\v 1 "Take care not to be doing your charitable giving before men, so as to be seen by them. Otherwise, you have not a reward from your Father in heaven.
\v 2 Whenever therefore you do charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by men. Assuredly I say to you, they receive their reward in full.
\v 3 But when you do charitable giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
\v 4 so that your charitable giving may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will Himself reward you openly.
\s1 Concerning Prayer
\p
\v 5 "And whenever you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.
\v 6 But you, whenever you pray, enter into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly.
\v 7 But when you pray, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
\v 8 Therefore do not be like them; for your Father knows what things you have need of before you ask Him.
\v 9 Therefore pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
\v 10 Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
\v 11 Give us this day our daily bread.
\v 12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
\v 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
\v 14 "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
\v 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
\s1 Concerning Fasting
\p
\v 16 "Moreover, when you fast, do not become gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.
\v 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
\v 18 so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.
\s1 Concerning Treasures
\p
\v 19 "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break in and steal;
\v 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\s1 The Sound Eye
\p
\v 22 "The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
\v 23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
\s1 Serving Two Masters
\p
\v 24 "No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and he will love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one, and he will despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
\s1 Do Not Worry
\p
\v 25 "Because of this I say to you, do not worry about your life—what you shall eat, or what you shall drink—nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?
\v 26 Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap, nor do they gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they?
\v 27 And which of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his height?
\v 28 So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither labor, nor spin;
\v 29 and yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
\v 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
\v 31 Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we put on?'
\v 32 "For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
\v 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.
\v 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own affairs. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
\c 7
\s1 Judging Others
\p
\v 1 "Judge not, lest you be judged.
\v 2 For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with what measure you measure, it will be measured back to you.
\v 3 And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?
\v 4 Or how will you say to your brother, 'Permit me to remove the speck from your eye'; and look, there is a plank in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First remove the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.
\v 6 Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
\s1 Ask, Seek, Knock
\p
\v 7 "Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
\v 8 For everyone that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks, it shall be opened.
\v 9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son should ask for bread, will give him a stone?
\v 10 And if he should ask for a fish, he will give him a serpent?
\v 11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, by how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
\v 12 Therefore, whatever you want people to do to you, you also do to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.
\s1 The Narrow Gate
\p
\v 13 "Enter in through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way which leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in through it.
\v 14 O how narrow the gate, and confined is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it!
\s1 Warning Against False Prophets
\p
\v 15 "But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
\v 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grape clusters from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 Thus every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.
\v 18 A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, neither can a bad tree produce good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
\v 20 Consequently, by their fruits you shall know them.
\s1 Concerning Self-Deception
\p
\v 21 "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name we cast out demons, and in Your name we did many mighty works?’
\v 23 "And then I will confess to them, 'I never knew you! DEPART FROM ME, YOU WORKERS OF INIQUITY!'
\s1 Hearers and Doers
\p
\v 24 "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them, I will compare him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock:
\v 25 and the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house; and it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.
\v 26 And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them, will be compared to a foolish man who built his house on the sand:
\v 27 and the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall."
\v 28 And so it was, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,
\v 29 for He taught them as one having authority, and not like the scribes.
\c 8
\s1 Jesus Cleanses a Leper
\p
\v 1 When He had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
\v 2 And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean."
\v 3 And reaching out His hand, Jesus touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
\v 4 And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
\s1 Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant
\p
\v 5 Now when He had entered Capernaum, a centurion approached Him, begging Him,
\v 6 and saying, "Lord, my servant has been laid up in the house a paralytic, being tormented terribly."
\v 7 And Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
\v 8 The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But just say the word and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
\v 10 When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who were following, "Assuredly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!
\v 11 And I say to you that many shall come from east and west, and recline to eat with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;
\v 12 but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; and as you believed, it shall be done for you." And his servant was healed that very hour.
\s1 Jesus Heals many at Peter’s House
\p
\v 14 Now when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed, and burning with fever.
\v 15 And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up, and began to serve Him.
\v 16 When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and He healed all that were sick,
\v 17 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES, AND BORE OUR DISEASES."
\s1 The Cost of Discipleship
\p
\v 18 And when Jesus saw great crowds around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.
\v 19 Then a certain scribe approached, and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
\v 20 And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
\v 21 Then another of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
\v 22 But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."
\s1 Jesus Calms a Storm
\p
\v 23 Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.
\v 24 And behold, a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered by waves; but He was sleeping.
\v 25 Then the disciples came and awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
\v 26 But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
\v 27 So the men marveled, saying, "What kind of Man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"
\s1 Jesus Heals the Demoniacs
\p
\v 28 And when He came to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs; exceedingly violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.
\v 29 And suddenly they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"
\v 30 Now there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding.
\v 31 So the demons implored Him, saying, "If You cast us out, permit us to go off into the herd of swine."
\v 32 And He said to them, "Go." So they came out, and went off into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine rushed violently down the steep bank into the sea, and died in the waters.
\v 33 Then those who tended them fled; and going off into the city, they reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
\v 34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And seeing Him, they implored Him that He might go away from their region.
\c 9
\s1 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
\p
\v 1 And getting into the boat, He crossed over and went into His own city.
\v 2 And behold, they were carrying a paralytic to Him lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Have courage, son; your sins are forgiven."
\v 3 And at once some of the scribes said among themselves, "This Man blasphemes!"
\v 4 But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
\v 5 For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?
\v 6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins"—then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
\v 7 And he arose, and went to his house.
\v 8 Now when the crowds saw, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
\s1 The Call of Matthew
\p
\v 9 And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax collector’s booth. And He said to him, "Follow Me." And he arose and followed Him.
\v 10 Now it came to pass, as He reclined to eat in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners, having come, were reclining to eat with Jesus and His disciples.
\v 11 And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
\v 12 When Jesus heard that, He said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
\v 13 But go and learn what this means: 'I DESIRE MERCY AND NOT SACRIFICE.' For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."
\s1 The Question About Fasting
\p
\v 14 Then the disciples of John approached Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"
\v 15 And Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
\v 16 No one puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.
\v 17 Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."
\s1 A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed
\p
\v 18 As He spoke these things to them, behold, a certain leader came and worshiped Him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she shall live."
\v 19 So Jesus arose and followed him, likewise His disciples.
\v 20 And behold, a woman hemorrhaging for twelve years, approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment.
\v 21 For she said to herself, "If only I may touch His garment, I will be healed."
\v 22 But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that hour.
\v 23 And when Jesus came into the house of the leader, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
\v 24 He said to them, "Make room, for the girl has not died, but she is sleeping." And they were ridiculing Him.
\v 25 But when the crowd had been put out, He went in and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose.
\v 26 And the report of this went out into that whole land.
\s1 Jesus Heals Two Blind Men
\p
\v 27 And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
\v 28 And when He came into the house, the blind men approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
\v 29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, let it be unto you."
\v 30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See that you let no one know."
\v 31 But they went out and spread the news about Him in that whole land.
\s1 A Mute Man Healed
\p
\v 32 And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a mute man who was demon-possessed.
\v 33 And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."
\v 35 And Jesus was going about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
\v 36 But seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and prostrated, like sheep having no shepherd.
\v 37 Then He said to His disciples, "Indeed the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
\v 38 Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest, that He may send forth workers into His harvest."
\c 10
\s1 The Twelve Apostles
\p
\v 1 And summoning His twelve disciples, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
\v 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
\v 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, who was surnamed Thaddaeus;
\v 4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
\s1 The Mission of the Twelve
\p
\v 5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, commanding them, saying, "Do not go in the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans.
\v 6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
\v 8 "Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
\v 9 Do not acquire gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,
\v 10 not a knapsack for the road, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food.
\v 11 And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go out.
\v 12 And as you enter into a household, greet it.
\v 13 And if indeed the house should be worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it should not be worthy, let your peace return to you.
\v 14 And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
\v 15 Assuredly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!
\s1 Coming Persecutions
\p
\v 16 "Behold, I am sending you forth like sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
\v 17 But beware of men, for they will hand you over to councils and they will flog you in their synagogues.
\v 18 And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the nations.
\v 19 But whenever they hand you over, do not worry how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;
\v 20 for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
\v 21 Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and put them to death.
\v 22 And you will be hated by all people for My name's sake. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.
\v 23 But whenever they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly I say to you, by no means will you have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
\v 24 A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for a disciple that he become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they malign the members of his household!
\v 26 Therefore do not fear them. For nothing is concealed that shall not be unveiled, or secret that shall not be made known.
\s1 Jesus Teaches the Fear of God
\p
\v 27 "What I say to you in the dark, say in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
\v 28 And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
\v 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 Therefore do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.
\v 32 "Therefore whoever who will confess Me before men, I also will confess Him before My Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever denies Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in heaven.
\v 34 "Do not suppose that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
\v 35 For I have come to 'TURN A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, and A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER MOTHER-IN-LAW';
\v 36 and 'A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS.'
\v 37 He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
\v 38 And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
\v 39 He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.
\v 40 "He that receives you receives Me, and he that receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
\v 41 He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
\v 42 And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward."
\c 11
\s1 John’s Questions
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus finished instructing His twelve disciples, that He moved on from there to teach and to preach in their cities.
\v 2 And when John had heard in prison about the works of the Messiah, having sent two of his disciples,
\v 3 he said to Him, "Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?"
\v 4 Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John the things which you hear and see:
\v 5 The BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up, and the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.
\v 6 And blessed is the one who is not offended because of Me."
\s1 Jesus’ Tribute to John
\p
\v 7 Now as these men were going, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
\v 8 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft garments are in kings' palaces.
\v 9 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and far more than a prophet.
\v 10 For this is he about whom it is written: 'BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER BEFORE YOUR FACE, WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.'
\v 11 "Assuredly I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\v 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men seize it.
\v 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
\v 14 And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come.
\v 15 He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
\v 16 But to what shall I compare this generation? It is similar to children who sit in the marketplaces and call to their playmates,
\v 17 and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; We mourned to you, and you did not lament.'
\v 18 "For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 19 "The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' And so wisdom is justified by her children."
\s1 Woes to Unrepentant Cities
\p
\v 20 Then He began to reproach the cities in which His very many miracles had been done, because they did not repent:
\v 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
\v 23 And you, Capernaum, the one having been exalted to heaven, you will be brought down to Hades; because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
\v 24 But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."
\v 25 At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.
\v 26 Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.
\v 27 All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone fully know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
\v 28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."
\c 12
\s1 Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath
\p
\v 1 At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath. And His disciples became hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
\v 2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
\v 3 But He said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and those who were with him:
\v 4 how they entered the house of God, and ate the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except only for the priests?
\v 5 Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
\v 6 Yet I say to you that One greater than the temple is here.
\v 7 But if you had known what this means, 'I DESIRE MERCY AND NOT SACRIFICE,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.
\v 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
\v 9 And having departed from there, He went into their synagogue.
\v 10 And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"—that they might accuse Him.
\v 11 Then He said to them, "What man is there among you who shall have one sheep, and if it should fall into a ditch on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?
\v 12 How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
\v 13 Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored whole like the other.
\v 14 But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, how they might destroy Him.
\v 15 But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew from there. And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.
\v 16 And He warned them that they should not make Him known,
\v 17 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\v 18 "BEHOLD, MY SERVANT WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN, MY BELOVED IN WHOM MY SOUL IS WELL PLEASED! I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT UPON HIM, AND HE WILL ANNOUNCE JUSTICE TO THE GENTILES.
\v 19 HE WILL NOT QUARREL NOR CRY OUT, NOR WILL ANYONE HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS.
\v 20 A BRUISED REED HE SHALL NOT BREAK, AND A SMOLDERING WICK HE SHALL NOT QUENCH, TILL HE BRING FORTH JUSTICE TO VICTORY;
\v 21 AND IN HIS NAME THE NATIONS SHALL HOPE."
\s1 The Pharisees Rebuked
\p
\v 22 Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.
\v 23 And all the crowds were amazed and said, "Can this be the Son of David?"
\v 24 But the Pharisees, having heard, said, "This Man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, ruler of the demons."
\v 25 But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
\v 26 And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
\v 28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 Or how is one able to enter a strong man’s house to plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his household.
\v 30 He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
\s1 The Unpardonable Sin
\p
\v 31 "Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.
\v 32 And whoever says a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age, or in the age to come.
\s1 A Tree and Its Fruit
\p
\v 33 "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
\v 34 You brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
\v 35 A good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things, and an evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things.
\v 36 But I say to you, that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
\v 37 For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."
\s1 The Sign of Jonah
\p
\v 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, "Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You."
\v 39 But He answered and said to them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
\v 40 For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
\v 41 The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
\v 42 The queen of the South shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and she shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
\v 43 "When an unclean spirit goes out from a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and does not find any.
\v 44 Then he says, 'I will return to my house from where I came out.' And when he comes, he finds it unoccupied, swept, and adorned.
\v 45 Then he goes and takes along with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and entering in they dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation."
\s1 Changed Relationships
\p
\v 46 And while He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.
\v 47 Then one said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You."
\v 48 But He answered and said to him that told Him, "Who is My mother? And who are My brothers?"
\v 49 And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, "Behold; My mother, and My brothers!
\v 50 For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother."
\c 13
\s1 The Parable of the Sower
\p
\v 1 On the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.
\v 2 And great crowds were gathered together to Him, so that He got into the boat and sat; and the crowd stood on the shore.
\v 3 And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, the sower went out to sow.
\v 4 And as he sowed, some seed fell alongside the road; and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 But others fell on the stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth.
\v 6 But when the sun rose, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away.
\v 7 But others fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them out.
\v 8 But others fell on good ground and it was yielding fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
\v 9 He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
\v 10 And the disciples approached and said to Him, "Why do You speak to them in parables?"
\v 11 He answered and said to them, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
\v 12 For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he shall have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.
\v 13 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
\v 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: 'HEARING YOU SHALL HEAR AND BY NO MEANS UNDERSTAND, AND SEEING YOU SHALL SEE AND BY NO MEANS PERCEIVE.
\v 15 FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL, AND THEIR EARS ARE HARD OF HEARING, AND THEIR EYES HAVE CLOSED, LEST THEY SHOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES, AND HEAR WITH THEIR EARS, LEST THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEARTS AND TURN BACK, THAT I SHOULD HEAL THEM.'
\v 16 "But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears, because they hear.
\v 17 For assuredly I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and they did not see, and to hear what you hear, and they did not hear.”
\v 18 "Therefore hear the parable of the sower:
\v 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, then the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed that was sown beside the road.
\v 20 But the seed sown on stony ground, is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;
\v 21 yet he has no firm root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.
\v 22 But the seed sown in the thorns is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches chokes out the word, and it becomes fruitless.
\v 23 But the seed sown on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold some sixty, some thirty."
\s1 The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares
\p
\v 24 Another parable He set before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man sowing good seed in his field.
\v 25 But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.
\v 26 But when the stalk had sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares also appeared.
\v 27 So the servants of the master of the house approached and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where then does it have tares?'
\v 28 "He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Do you wish then that we should go and gather them up?'
\v 29 "But he said, 'No, lest gathering up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them.
\v 30 Leave both to grow together until the harvest; and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares, and bind them into bundles to burn them, but gather together the wheat into my barn." ' "
\s1 The Parable of the Mustard Seed
\p
\v 31 Another parable He set before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,
\v 32 which indeed is smaller than all the seeds; but whenever it is grown, it is greater than the garden vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."
\s1 The Parable of the Leaven
\p
\v 33 Another parable He spoke to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."
\v 34 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and without a parable He did not speak to them,
\v 35 so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: "I WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN PARABLES; I WILL UTTER THINGS HAVING BEEN HIDDEN FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD."
\s1 The Parable of the Tares Explained
\p
\v 36 Then having dismissed the crowds, Jesus went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
\v 37 He answered and said to them: "He that sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
\v 38 And the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the evil one.
\v 39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
\v 40 Therefore just as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of this age.
\v 41 The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who work iniquity,
\v 42 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”
\s1 The Hidden Treasure
\p
\v 44 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it, he went and sold everything he had, and bought that field.”
\s1 The Pearl of Great Price
\p
\v 45 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,
\v 46 who, when he found one very precious pearl, went and sold everything he had and bought it.”
\s1 A Dragnet
\p
\v 47 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind,
\v 48 and when it was filled, they drew it up on the beach; and they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but the bad they threw away.
\v 49 So it will be at the end of the age: the angels shall go forth and separate the evil from among the righteous,
\v 50 and cast them into the fiery furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
\v 51 Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
\v 52 Then He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house who brings out of his treasure both new things and old."
\s1 Jesus Rejected at Nazareth
\p
\v 53 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He went away from there.
\v 54 And coming into His hometown, He began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this Man get this wisdom and these powerful works?
\v 55 Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Jude?
\v 56 And His sisters, are they not all with us? From where then did this Man get all these things?"
\v 57 So they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and in his own house."
\v 58 And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
\c 14
\s1 The Death of John the Baptist
\p
\v 1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus,
\v 2 and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."
\v 3 For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
\v 4 For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
\v 5 And though he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet.
\v 6 Now when Herod's birthday was being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and she pleased Herod.
\v 7 Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
\v 8 So she, being urged on by her mother, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
\v 9 And the king was grieved, but because of the oaths, and because of those who reclined to eat with him, he commanded it to be given.
\v 10 He sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
\v 11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
\v 12 Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and reported it to Jesus.
\s1 Feeding the Five Thousand
\p
\v 13 Now when Jesus heard it, He withdrew from there in a boat for a deserted place privately. But when the crowds heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
\v 14 And coming out, Jesus saw a large crowd, and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.
\v 15 Now when it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, "The place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds, that they may go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
\v 16 But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat!"
\v 17 And they said to Him, "We do not have anything here except five loaves of bread and two fish."
\v 18 But He said, "Bring them here to Me."
\v 19 And commanding the crowds to sit down on the grass, taking the five loaves of bread and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed the food, and breaking the loaves, He gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
\v 20 So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up what they had left of the fragments, twelve baskets full.
\v 21 Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
\s1 Jesus Walks on Water
\p
\v 22 And immediately Jesus compelled the disciples to get into the boat, and to go ahead of Him to the other side, until He could dismiss the crowds.
\v 23 And having dismissed the crowds, He went up on the mountain privately to pray. And when evening had come, He was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, being harassed by the waves, for the wind was against them.
\v 25 Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
\v 26 And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear.
\v 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take courage! It is I; do not fear."
\v 28 But Peter answered Him and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
\v 29 So He said, "Come." And stepping down from the boat, Peter walked on the water to go toward Jesus.
\v 30 But seeing the strong wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
\v 31 And immediately, Jesus reaching out His hand, laid hold of him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
\v 32 And when they had gotten into the boat, the wind ceased.
\v 33 Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God."
\v 34 And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
\v 35 And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, and they brought to Him all those who were sick,
\v 36 and implored Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were completely healed.
\c 15
\s1 The Tradition of the Elders
\p
\v 1 Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem approached Jesus, saying,
\v 2 "Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands whenever they eat bread."
\v 3 He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God on account of your tradition?
\v 4 For God commanded, saying, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER'; and, 'WHOEVER REVILES FATHER OR MOTHER MUST SURELY DIE.'
\v 5 But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "It is a gift to God, whatever profit you might have received from me"—
\v 6 then by no means should he honor his father or mother.' Thus you have invalidated the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition.
\v 7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying,
\v 8 'THESE PEOPLE DRAW NEAR TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTH, AND THEY HONOR ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.
\v 9 AND IN VAIN THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN.' "
\v 10 And having summoned the crowd, He said to them, "Hear and understand:
\v 11 It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."
\v 12 Then His disciples approached and said to Him, "You know that when the Pharisees heard this message they were offended?"
\v 13 But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
\v 14 Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guides the blind, both will fall into a ditch."
\v 15 Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain to us this parable."
\v 16 So Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding?
\v 17 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated?
\v 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.
\v 19 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
\v 20 These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."
\s1 The Canaanite Woman’s Faith
\p
\v 21 And going out from there, Jesus withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman coming forth from that region cried out to Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed."
\v 23 But He answered her not a word. And His disciples approached and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."
\v 24 But He answered and said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
\v 25 Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
\v 26 But He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and to throw it to the little dogs."
\v 27 But she said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat from the crumbs falling from their masters' table."
\v 28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
\s1 Jesus Heals Many People
\p
\v 29 And moving on from there, Jesus came alongside the Sea of Galilee, and going up into a mountain, He sat down there.
\v 30 And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they put them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them.
\v 31 So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
\s1 Jesus Feeds Four Thousand
\p
\v 32 Now Jesus, having summoned His disciples, He said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with Me three days, and they do not have anything to eat. And I do not desire to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
\v 33 Then His disciples said to Him, "Where could we get so many loaves of bread in this deserted place, so as to satisfy so great a crowd?"
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
\v 35 So He commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground.
\v 36 And He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, He broke them, and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the crowd.
\v 37 So they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what they had left of the fragments, seven baskets full.
\v 38 Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
\v 39 And having dismissed the crowds, He went up into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala.
\c 16
\s1 The Demand for a Sign
\p
\v 1 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him, they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
\v 2 He answered and said to them, "When evening comes you say, 'Fine weather, for the sky is red'.
\v 3 And in the morning, 'Today will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You hypocrites! Indeed you know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
\v 4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet." And leaving them behind He went away.
\s1 The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
\p
\v 5 Now when His disciples had come to the other side, they forgot to take bread.
\v 6 Then Jesus said to them, "Look out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
\v 7 But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "We did not take bread."
\v 8 But Jesus, knowing about it, said to them, "O you of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves, because you did not take bread?
\v 9 Do you not yet perceive, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?
\v 11 How is it you do not perceive that I did not speak to you about bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?"
\v 12 Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\s1 Peter Confesses Christ
\p
\v 13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He was questioning His disciples, saying, "Who do men pronounce Me, the Son of Man, to be?"
\v 14 So they said, "Some say John the Baptist, but others say Elijah, and yet others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
\v 15 He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?"
\v 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
\v 17 Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I shall build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
\v 19 And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on the earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth will have been loosed in heaven."
\v 20 Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.
\s1 Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection
\p
\v 21 From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go off to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised up on the third day.
\v 22 And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him, saying, "God be gracious to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!"
\v 23 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, because you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."
\s1 The Cross and Self-Denial
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
\v 25 For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of Me shall find it.
\v 26 For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
\v 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will render to each according to his works.
\v 28 Assuredly I say to you, there are some standing here who will by no means taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."
\c 17
\s1 The Transfiguration
\p
\v 1 Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain in private;
\v 2 and He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as light.
\v 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
\v 4 Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You desire, let us make here three tents: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
\v 5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!"
\v 6 And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and they were greatly afraid.
\v 7 But Jesus approached and touched them and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
\v 8 And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus alone.
\v 9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead."
\v 10 And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
\v 11 Jesus answered and said to them, "Elijah truly does come first, and shall restore all things.
\v 12 But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they desired. Thus also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them."
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.
\s1 Jesus Cures a Boy with a Demon
\p
\v 14 And when they came to the crowd, a man approached Him, kneeling down to Him, and saying,
\v 15 "Lord, have pity on my son, for he is moonstruck and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
\v 16 So I brought him to Your disciples, but they were not able to heal him."
\v 17 Then Jesus answered and said, "O unfaithful and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me."
\v 18 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out from him; and the boy was healed from that very hour.
\v 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"
\v 20 So Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief; for assuredly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, 'Be moved from here to there,' and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible for you.
\v 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."
\s1 Jesus Again Foretells His Death and Resurrection
\p
\v 22 And while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,
\v 23 and they will kill Him, and on the third day He shall be raised." And they were exceedingly sorrowful.
\s1 Jesus and the Temple Tax
\p
\v 24 When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the temple tax came to Peter and said, "Does your Teacher not pay the temple tax?"
\v 25 He said, "Yes." And when he entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?"
\v 26 Peter said to Him, "From strangers." Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free.
\v 27 Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a coin. Take that, and give it to them for Me and for yourself."
\c 18
\s1 True Greatness
\p
\v 1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
\v 2 Then Jesus called a little child, and set him in their midst,
\v 3 and said, "Assuredly I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you shall by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
\v 4 Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 5 And whoever receives one such little child in My name, receives Me.
\s1 Jesus Warns of Offenses
\p
\v 6 "But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone be hanged on his neck, and he be drowned in the depth of the sea.
\v 7 Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must come, but woe to that man through whom the offense comes!
\v 8 And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut them off and cast them from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, than having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire.
\v 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than having two eyes, to be thrown into the fiery hell.
\s1 The Parable of the Lost Sheep
\p
\v 10 "See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.
\v 11 For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.
\v 12 What do you think? If a certain man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains, and go and search for the one gone astray?
\v 13 And if he happens to find it, assuredly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which did not go astray.
\v 14 Thus it is not the will before your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
\s1 Reproving Another Who Sins
\p
\v 15 "And if your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have won your brother.
\v 16 But if he does not hear, take along with you one or two more, so that 'BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY WORD MAY BE ESTABLISHED.'
\v 17 But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you as a heathen and a tax collector.
\v 18 Assuredly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Again, assuredly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst."
\s1 Forgiveness
\p
\v 21 Then Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
\v 22 Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.
\v 23 Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
\v 24 And when he began to settle up, one debtor was brought to him owing ten thousand talents.
\v 25 But since he had nothing with which to repay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and everything that he had, and to be repaid.
\v 26 Therefore falling down before him, the servant said, 'Master, have patience with me, and I will repay everything to you.'
\v 27 And having compassion, the master of that servant released him, and forgave him the debt.
\v 28 But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And taking hold of him, he was choking him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
\v 29 So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and kept begging him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.'
\v 30 But he was not willing, but going off, he cast him into prison till he should pay back what was owed.
\v 31 So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were deeply grieved, and they came and narrated to their master all that had taken place.
\v 32 Then summoning him, his master said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
\v 33 Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, as I also had compassion on you?'
\v 34 And being angered, his master handed him over to the tormentors until he should pay all that was owed to him.
\v 35 Thus also My heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not forgive each one his brother their trespasses, from your hearts."
\c 19
\s1 Marriage and Divorce
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, that He departed from Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
\v 3 The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?"
\v 4 And He answered and said to them, "Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning 'MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE,'
\v 5 and He said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?
\v 6 So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."
\v 7 They said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?"
\v 8 He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been this way.
\v 9 And I say to you, that whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marrying a divorcee commits adultery."
\v 10 His disciples said to Him, "If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
\v 11 But He said to them, "All cannot accept this saying, but it is for those to whom it has been given:
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were born this way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it."
\s1 Jesus Blesses Little Children
\p
\v 13 Then little children were brought to Him, that He might put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.
\v 14 But Jesus said, "Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
\v 15 And having put His hands on them, He departed from there.
\s1 The Rich Young Ruler
\p
\v 16 And behold, one came and said to Him, "Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?"
\v 17 So He said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
\v 18 He said to Him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, " 'YOU SHALL NOT MURDER,' 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,' 'YOU SHALL NOT STEAL,' 'YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS,'
\v 19 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER,' and, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.' "
\v 20 The young man said to Him, "All these have I kept from my youth. What do I still lack?"
\v 21 Jesus said to him, "If you desire to be perfect, go, sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
\v 22 But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieved, for he had many possessions.
\s1 Riches a Snare
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "Assuredly I say to you, that with difficulty a rich man shall enter the kingdom of heaven.
\v 24 And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
\v 25 And when His disciples heard, they were greatly astonished, and said, "Who then is able to be saved?"
\v 26 And looking at them, Jesus said to them, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
\v 27 Then Peter answered and said to Him, "See, we have left all and followed You. What then shall we have?"
\v 28 So Jesus said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, that in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
\v 30 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
\c 20
\s1 The Laborers in the Vineyard
\p
\v 1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a certain landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
\v 2 And having agreed with the workers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\v 3 And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
\v 4 And said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever may be right I will give you.' So they went.
\v 5 Again going out about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did likewise.
\v 6 And about the eleventh hour, going out he found others standing idle, and said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'
\v 7 "They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you shall receive.'
\v 8 "So when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.'
\v 9 "And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.
\v 10 But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they also received each a denarius.
\v 11 And when they had received it, they began grumbling against the landowner,
\v 12 saying, 'These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.'
\v 13 "But he answered one of them and said, 'Friend, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
\v 14 Take what is yours and go. But I want to give to this last man the same as to you.
\v 15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?'
\v 16 "Thus the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen."
\s1 A Third Time Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection
\p
\v 17 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took aside the twelve disciples privately on the road, and He said to them,
\v 18 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,
\v 19 and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He shall rise again."
\s1 Greatness is Serving
\p
\v 20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him with her sons, worshipping Him, and asking something from Him.
\v 21 And He said to her, "What do you desire?" She said to Him, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and one on Your left, in Your kingdom."
\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to Him, "We are able."
\v 23 So He said to them, "You will indeed drink My cup, and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is to those for whom it has been prepared by My Father."
\v 24 And when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
\v 25 But Jesus, having summoned them, said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
\v 26 Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, shall be your servant.
\v 27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave;
\v 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many."
\s1 Jesus Heals Two Blind Men
\p
\v 29 Now as they went out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.
\v 30 And behold, two blind men sitting alongside the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, "Have pity on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
\v 31 But the crowd warned them that they should be silent; but they cried out all the more, saying, "Have pity on us, O Lord, Son of David!"
\v 32 And having stood still, Jesus called them, and said, "What do you desire that I should do for you?"
\v 33 They said to Him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
\v 34 And Jesus, having compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.
\c 21
\s1 The Triumphal Entry
\p
\v 1 Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, towards the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
\v 2 saying to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied up, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me.
\v 3 And if anyone asks you anything, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and immediately he will send them."
\v 4 Now all this took place so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
\v 5 "SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, HUMBLE, AND SITTING ON A DONKEY, A COLT, THE FOAL OF A DONKEY.' "
\v 6 So the disciples went, and did just as Jesus ordered them.
\v 7 They brought the donkey and the colt, and they laid their clothes on them, and they set Him on them.
\v 8 And a very large crowd spread their clothes on the road; but others were cutting down branches from the trees and were spreading them on the road.
\v 9 Then the crowds who went before, and those following were crying out, saying: "Hosanna to the Son of David! 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!' Hosanna in the highest!"
\v 10 And when He entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, "Who is this?"
\v 11 And the crowds were saying, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee."
\s1 Jesus Cleanses the Temple
\p
\v 12 Then Jesus went into the temple of God and He cast out all those buying and selling in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
\v 13 And He said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER,' but you have made it a 'DEN OF THIEVES.'"
\v 14 Then the lame and the blind came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
\v 15 But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders which He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they became indignant,
\v 16 and said to Him, "Do You hear what these children are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes. Have you never read, 'OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES AND NURSING INFANTS YOU HAVE PERFECTED PRAISE'?"
\v 17 And having left them, He went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
\s1 Jesus Curses the Fig Tree
\p
\v 18 Now in the early morning, returning to the city, He became hungry.
\v 19 And seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, "May no fruit come from you ever again!" And immediately the fig tree withered away.
\v 20 And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree wither away so soon?"
\v 21 So Jesus answered and said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you should say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen.
\v 22 And all things, as many as you may ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive."
\s1 The Authority of Jesus Questioned
\p
\v 23 Now as He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people confronted Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?"
\v 24 But Jesus answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:
\v 25 The baptism of John—where was it from? From heaven or from men?" And they were arguing among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
\v 26 But if we should say, 'From men,' we fear the crowd, for all regard John as a prophet."
\v 27 So they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." And He said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
\s1 The Parable of the Two Sons
\p
\v 28 "But what do you think? A man had two children. And having come to the first, he said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
\v 29 "But he answered and said, 'I will not,' but later he regretted it and went.
\v 30 And having come to the other, he said likewise. And he answered and said, 'I am going, sir,' but he did not go.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said to Him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you.
\v 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; but you, having seen, did not repent afterwards, that you might believe him.
\s1 The Parable of the Wicked Tenants
\p
\v 33 "Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to farmers and went away on a journey.
\v 34 Now when the harvest time of fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, that they might collect his fruits.
\v 35 And the farmers took his servants, and they beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
\v 36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did to them likewise.
\v 37 And at last he sent to them his son, saying, 'Surely they will respect my son.'
\v 38 "But when the farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and let us gain possession of his inheritance.'
\v 39 "And taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.
\v 40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?"
\v 41 They said to Him, "He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other farmers, who will render to him the fruits in their seasons."
\v 42 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED HAS BECOME THE CHIEF CORNERSTONE. THIS WAS THE LORD'S DOING, AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES'?
\v 43 "Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and it shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.
\v 44 And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder."
\v 45 Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they knew that He was speaking about them.
\v 46 And seeking to seize Him, they feared the crowds, since they considered Him to be a prophet.
\c 22
\s1 The Parable of the Wedding Banquet
\p
\v 1 And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying,
\v 2 "The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a wedding for his son,
\v 3 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they did not want to come.
\v 4 Again, he sent out other servants, saying, 'Say to those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding." '
\v 5 "But not caring, they went away, one to his own field, another to his business.
\v 6 And the rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
\v 7 And when that king heard, he was furious. And he sent out his troops, and he destroyed those murderers, and he burned up their city.
\v 8 Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding indeed is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
\v 9 Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.'
\v 10 "So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.
\v 11 But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there not dressed with wedding clothes.
\v 12 So he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not having wedding clothes?' And he was speechless.
\v 13 Then the king said to the servants, 'Tie him up hands and feet, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
\v 14 "For many are called, but few are chosen."
\s1 The Question about Paying Taxes
\p
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap Him in His speech.
\v 16 And they sent their disciples to Him with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You show favoritism to anyone.
\v 17 Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
\v 18 But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, "Why do you test Me, you hypocrites?
\v 19 Show Me the tax money." So they brought Him a denarius.
\v 20 And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"
\v 21 They said to Him, "Caesar's." And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
\v 22 When they had heard these words, they marveled, and leaving Him, they went away.
\s1 The Question about the Resurrection
\p
\v 23 The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him, and they questioned Him,
\v 24 saying: "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife as next of kin, and shall raise up offspring for his brother.
\v 25 Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died, after having married, and having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
\v 26 Likewise the second also, and the third, down to the seventh.
\v 27 Last of all the woman died also.
\v 28 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her."
\v 29 Jesus answered and said to them, "You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God!
\v 30 For in the resurrection neither do they marry, nor are they given in marriage, but they are like angels of God in heaven.
\v 31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,
\v 32 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
\v 33 And when the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.
\s1 The Greatest Commandment
\p
\v 34 But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
\v 35 Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,
\v 36 "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"
\v 37 Jesus said to him, “'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'
\v 38 This is the first and great commandment.
\v 39 And the second is like it: 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'
\v 40 On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."
\s1 The Question about David’s Son
\p
\v 41 And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
\v 42 saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?" They said to Him, "David’s."
\v 43 He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying:
\v 44 'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, "SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, TILL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET" '?
\v 45 "If David therefore calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his Son?"
\v 46 And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him any longer.
\c 23
\s1 Jesus Denounces Scribes and Pharisees
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
\v 2 saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat.
\v 3 Therefore whatever they may say to you to observe, observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.
\v 4 For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they do not desire to move them with their finger.
\v 5 But all their works they do in order to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and they enlarge the borders of their garments.
\v 6 They love the first couch at banquets, and the best seats in the synagogues,
\v 7 and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, 'Rabbi, Rabbi.'
\v 8 "But you, do not be called 'Rabbi'; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brothers.
\v 9 Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
\v 10 Neither be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ.
\v 11 But the greatest of you shall be your servant.
\v 12 And whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.
\v 13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
\v 14 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the kingdom of heaven before men; for you do not enter, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you travel around land and sea to make one proselyte, and whenever he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you.
\v 16 Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, is obligated.'
\v 17 "Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
\v 18 And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, is obligated.'
\v 19 "Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
\v 20 Therefore he that swears by the altar, swears by it and by all the things on it.
\v 21 He that swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwelt in it.
\v 22 And he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
\v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the more important things of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These things you ought to have done, and not have neglected the others.
\v 24 Blind guides, you who strain out a gnat, but swallow a camel!
\v 25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and unrighteousness.
\v 26 Blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside of them may be clean also.
\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness.
\v 28 Thus also you outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
\v 30 and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'
\v 31 "So that you testify against yourselves that you are sons of those who killed the prophets.
\v 32 And you, fill up then, the measure of your fathers' guilt.
\v 33 Serpents! Brood of vipers! How shall you escape from the condemnation of hell?
\v 34 Therefore, behold, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and you will crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and you will persecute from city to city,
\v 35 so that on you may come all the righteous blood being shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
\v 36 Assuredly I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
\s1 Jesus Laments over Jerusalem
\p
\v 37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
\v 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I say to you, you shall by no means see Me from now until you say, 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!' "
\c 24
\s1 The Destruction of the Temple Foretold
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came to Him to point out to Him the buildings of the temple.
\v 2 But Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Assuredly I say to you, by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down."
\s1 Signs of the End of the Age
\p
\v 3 And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"
\v 4 And Jesus answered and said to them: "Take heed that no one deceives you.
\v 5 For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many.
\v 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not disturbed; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
\v 9 Then they will hand you over to tribulation and they will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations, on account of My name.
\v 10 And then many will fall away, and they will betray one another, and they will hate one another.
\v 11 Then many false prophets will be raised up, and they will deceive many.
\v 12 And because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold.
\v 13 But he who endures to the end shall be saved.
\v 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
\s1 The Great Tribulation
\p
\v 15 "Therefore when you see the ‘ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION,’ spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand),
\v 16 “then let those who are in Judea flee upon the mountains.
\v 17 Let the one on the housetop not go down to take the things out of his house.
\v 18 And let the one in the field not turn back to take his clothes.
\v 19 But woe to those women who are pregnant, and to the women nursing a baby in those days!
\v 20 But pray that your flight may not take place in winter, nor on the Sabbath.
\v 21 For then there shall be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, nor by any means shall be.
\v 22 And unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be cut short.
\v 23 Then if someone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe it.
\v 24 For false christs and false prophets will be raised up, and they will show great signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
\v 25 See, I have told you in advance.
\v 26 Therefore if they should say to you, 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out; or 'Look, He is in the inner rooms!' do not believe it.
\v 27 For as the lightning comes out from the east and flashes to the west, so also will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 28 For wherever the carcass may be, there the eagles will be gathered together.
\s1 The Coming of the Son of Man
\p
\v 29 "Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give its light; and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
\v 30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\v 31 And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
\s1 The Parable of the Fig Tree
\p
\v 32 "Now learn this parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch already becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
\v 33 So you also, whenever you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors!
\v 34 Assuredly I say to you, this generation shall by no means pass away till all these things are fulfilled.
\v 35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.
\s1 The Necessity for Watchfulness
\p
\v 36 "But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only.
\v 37 But just as the days of Noah were, so also shall be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 38 For just as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
\v 39 and they didn’t know a thing until the flood came and took them all away, so also shall be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 40 Then two will be in the field: one will be taken, and one will be left.
\v 41 Two will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken, and one will be left.
\v 42 Watch therefore, for you do not know in what hour your Lord is coming.
\v 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have kept watch, and he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 For this reason you also must be ready, for at an hour that you think not, the Son of Man comes.
\s1 The Faithful Servant and the Evil Servant
\p
\v 45 "Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master appointed over his household, to give them food in due season?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.
\v 47 Assuredly I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his possessions.
\v 48 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, 'My master is delaying to come,'
\v 49 and should begin to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards,
\v 50 the master of that servant will come on a day which he does not expect, and in an hour which he does not know,
\v 51 and he will cut him in two, and will appoint his share with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\c 25
\s1 The Parable of the Ten Virgins
\p
\v 1 "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who having taken their lamps, went out to meet the bridegroom.
\v 2 Now five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
\v 3 Those who were foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them,
\v 4 but the wise took oil in their vessels along with their lamps.
\v 5 But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.
\v 6 And at midnight a cry was heard: 'Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!'
\v 7 Then all those virgins arose, and they trimmed their lamps.
\v 8 And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
\v 9 But the wise answered, saying, 'No, lest there should not be enough for you and us; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.'
\v 10 But as they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.
\v 11 Afterward the remaining virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!'
\v 12 But he answered and said, 'Assuredly I say to you, I do not know you.'
\v 13 Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.
\s1 The Parable of the Talents
\p
\v 14 "For it is as if a man leaving on a journey, who called his own servants and handed over his possessions to them.
\v 15 And to the one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey.
\v 16 Then the one receiving the five talents went and traded with them, and made five other talents.
\v 17 And likewise the one receiving the two gained two more also.
\v 18 But the one receiving one went away and dug in the ground, and hid his lord's money.
\v 19 Then after much time, the lord of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
\v 20 And the one who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I gained five more talents besides them.'
\v 21 His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
\v 22 And also the one receiving the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.'
\v 23 His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
\v 24 Then the one having received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
\v 25 And being afraid, I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Look, you have what is yours.'
\v 26 But his lord answered and said to him, 'You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.
\v 27 Therefore you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received what is mine with interest.
\v 28 Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.
\v 29 For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but to him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.
\v 30 And cast the useless servant into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
\s1 The Judgment of the Nations
\p
\v 31 "And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then will He sit upon His glorious throne.
\v 32 All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left.
\v 34 Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
\v 35 for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;
\v 36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.'
\v 37 Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?
\v 38 When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?
\v 39 Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?'
\v 40 And the King will answer and say to them, 'Assuredly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers, you did it to Me.'
\v 41 Then He will also say to those on the left, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:
\v 42 for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.'
\v 44 Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and we did not minister to You?'
\v 45 Then He will answer them, saying, 'Assuredly I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither did you do it to Me.'
\v 46 And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
\c 26
\s1 The Plot to Kill Jesus
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, that He said to His disciples,
\v 2 “You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
\v 3 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were assembled into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
\v 4 and plotted to take Jesus by guile and kill Him.
\v 5 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a disturbance take place among the people."
\s1 The Anointing at Bethany
\p
\v 6 And when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
\v 7 a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume, and she began to pour it on His head as He reclined to eat.
\v 8 But when His disciples saw it, they became indignant, saying, "Why this waste?
\v 9 For this perfume could have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
\v 10 But when Jesus became aware of it, He said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful work for Me.
\v 11 For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always.
\v 12 For this woman, having put this perfume on My body, has done this for My burial.
\v 13 Assuredly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will be spoken of as a memorial to her."
\s1 Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus
\p
\v 14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
\v 15 and said, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?" And they weighed out for him thirty silver coins.
\v 16 And from then on he sought an opportunity to betray Him.
\s1 Jesus Celebrates the Passover
\p
\v 17 Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do You desire that we shall prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
\v 18 And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples." ' "
\v 19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.
\v 20 And when it was evening, He was reclining to eat with the twelve.
\v 21 Now while they were eating, He said, "Assuredly I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."
\v 22 And becoming exceedingly sorrowful, each of them began to say to Him, "Surely not I, Lord?"
\v 23 He answered and said, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl will betray Me.
\v 24 Indeed, the Son of Man goes just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
\v 25 Then Judas, the one betraying Him, answered and said, "Surely not I am the one, Rabbi?" He said to him, "You have said it."
\s1 The Institution of the Lord’s Supper
\p
\v 26 And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread, and giving thanks, He broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."
\v 27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you,
\v 28 for this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many, for the forgiveness of sins.
\v 29 But I say to you, that I will by no means drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom."
\v 30 And having sung hymns, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\s1 Peter’s Denial Foretold
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of Me on this night, for it is written: 'I WILL STRIKE THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP OF THE FLOCK WILL BE SCATTERED.'
\v 32 But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."
\v 33 Peter answered and said to Him, "Even if all may fall away because of You, yet I will never fall away."
\v 34 Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you that on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."
\v 35 Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, by no means will I deny You!" And likewise said all the disciples.
\s1 Jesus Prays in Gethsemane
\p
\v 36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go off and pray over there."
\v 37 And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
\v 38 Then Jesus said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me."
\v 39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will."
\v 40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What? Were you not strong enough to watch with Me one hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. Indeed the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
\v 42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done."
\v 43 And He came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
\v 44 And leaving them, He went away again, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
\v 45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Sleep now, and rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Rise up, let us be going. See, he who betrays Me is at hand."
\s1 The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus
\p
\v 47 And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\v 48 Now the one betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I shall kiss, He is the One; seize Him."
\v 49 And immediately he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed Him.
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
\v 51 And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, he cut off his ear.
\v 52 But Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword shall perish by the sword.
\v 53 Or do you think that I cannot now call upon My Father, and He will furnish Me with more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?"
\v 55 In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to arrest Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.
\v 56 But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled." Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.
\s1 Jesus Before the High Priest
\p
\v 57 And those having seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
\v 58 But Peter was following Him from a distance, up to the courtyard of the high priest. And entering inside, he sat down with the attendants to see the end.
\v 59 Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the Sanhedrin were seeking false witnesses against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death,
\v 60 and they did not find any. And though many false witnesses came forward, they did not find any. But at last two false witnesses came forward
\v 61 and said, "This Man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.' "
\v 62 And standing up the high priest said to Him, "Do You answer nothing? What is it these men are testifying against You?"
\v 63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!"
\v 64 Jesus said to him, "You said it. Nevertheless, I say to you, from now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy!
\v 66 What do you think?" They answered and said, "He is deserving of death."
\v 67 Then they spat in His face, and beat Him with their fists; and they slapped Him,
\v 68 saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is he that struck You?"
\s1 Peter’s Denial of Jesus
\p
\v 69 Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
\v 70 But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."
\v 71 And when he had gone out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to them there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."
\v 72 But again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the Man!"
\v 73 And after a little while, those standing by came up and said to Peter, "Surely you also are one of them, for your accent gives you away."
\v 74 Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the Man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
\v 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which He said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And going out, he wept bitterly.
\c 27
\s1 Jesus Brought Before Pilate
\p
\v 1 When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus, so as to put Him to death.
\v 2 And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
\s1 Judas Hangs Himself
\p
\v 3 Then Judas, the one betraying Him, seeing that He was condemned, feeling regret, returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders,
\v 4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." And they said, "What is that to us? You see to it!"
\v 5 And throwing the silver coins in the sanctuary, he departed; and going away, he hanged himself.
\v 6 But the chief priests, taking the silver coins said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since they are the price of blood."
\v 7 And taking counsel, they bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
\v 8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
\v 9 Then was fulfilled the thing spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY COINS, THE VALUE OF HIM WHO WAS PRICED,” whom they of the sons of Israel priced,
\v 10 "AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE POTTER'S FIELD, AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME."
\s1 Pilate Questions Jesus
\p
\v 11 Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" So Jesus said to him, "It is as you say."
\v 12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
\v 13 Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"
\v 14 And He answered him not one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
\s1 Barabbas or Jesus?
\p
\v 15 Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished.
\v 16 And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
\v 17 Therefore when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you wish that I should release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
\v 18 For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.
\v 19 Now as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him."
\v 20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, but they should destroy Jesus.
\v 21 The governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
\v 22 Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let Him be crucified!"
\v 23 Then the governor said, "Why, what evil did He do?" But they cried out all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified!"
\v 24 And Pilate, seeing that nothing was being gained, but rather a riot was starting, taking water, he washed his hands clean in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just Man. You see to it."
\v 25 And all the people answered and said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
\v 26 Then he released Barabbas to them; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.
\s1 The Soldiers Mock Jesus
\p
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, gathered the whole garrison around Him.
\v 28 And having stripped Him, they put a scarlet robe on Him.
\v 29 When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
\v 30 And spitting on Him, they took the reed and were striking Him on His head.
\v 31 And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe, and dressed Him in His own clothes, and led Him away in order to crucify Him.
\s1 The Crucifixion of Jesus
\p
\v 32 And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they pressed into service that he might carry His cross.
\v 33 And coming to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,
\v 34 they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But having tasted it, He would not drink.
\v 35 And having crucified Him, they divided His clothes among themselves, casting lots.
\v 36 And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.
\v 37 And they put up over His head the crime having been written against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\v 38 Then they crucified two thieves with Him, one on His right, and another on His left.
\v 39 And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads
\v 40 and saying, "You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
\v 41 Likewise the chief priests also, mocking Him with the scribes and elders, and Pharisees, said,
\v 42 He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on Him.
\v 43 He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now, if He will have Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.' "
\v 44 Even the thieves who were crucified with Him were reviling Him with the same insult.
\s1 The Death of Jesus
\p
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour, darkness came upon all the land.
\v 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?" that is, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"
\v 47 Some of those standing by, when they heard this, said, "This Man is calling Elijah!"
\v 48 Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, and filled it with sour wine and put it around a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.
\v 49 But the rest said, "Leave Him alone; let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him."
\v 50 But Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, released His spirit.
\v 51 And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split,
\v 52 and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had passed away were raised;
\v 53 and coming forth out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
\v 54 So when the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were greatly afraid, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
\v 55 And there were many women there observing from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,
\v 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
\s1 The Burial of Jesus
\p
\v 57 Now when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
\v 58 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him.
\v 59 And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth,
\v 60 and placed it in his new tomb which he had cut in the rock; and having rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, he departed.
\v 61 And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.
\s1 The Guard at the Tomb
\p
\v 62 On the next day, which is after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
\v 63 saying, "Sir, we remember how that deceiver said while He was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'
\v 64 "Therefore command that the grave be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him, and say to the people, 'He was raised from the dead.' So the last deception will be worse than the first."
\v 65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go make it as secure as you know how."
\v 66 So they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone, with the guard.
\c 28
\s1 The Resurrection of Jesus
\p
\v 1 But after the Sabbath, at the dawning toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
\v 2 And behold, a great earthquake occurred; for an angel of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.
\v 3 And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
\v 4 And the guards were shaken for fear of him, and became like dead men.
\v 5 But the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
\v 6 He is not here! For He is risen, just as He said. Come; see the place where the Lord was lying.
\v 7 And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you."
\v 8 And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report to His disciples.
\v 9 And as they were going to report to His disciples, that behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" So they came and held His feet and worshiped Him.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go, report to My brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see Me."
\s1 The Report of the Guard
\p
\v 11 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
\v 12 When they had assembled with the elders and taking counsel, they gave sufficient silver coins to the soldiers,
\v 13 saying, "Tell them, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.'
\v 14 "And if this reaches the governor's ears, we will influence him and make you secure."
\v 15 So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this saying has been widely spread among the Jews until this day.
\s1 The Great Commission
\p
\v 16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.
\v 17 When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted.
\v 18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.
\v 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
\v 20 teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.
